As Kivinen (2002) notes, political decision-making regarding the modernization agenda of basically all Soviet as well Russian leaders has allegedly been based on the 'sacred' objectives of science, that is, promoting progress and modernization, and producing economic growth and well-being via expanding industrial production. This consecration has unintended results that are turned into a 'negative sacred' that cannot be addressed in the political and public arenas (Kivinen 2002, pp. 215-22). The 'negative sacred', especially three such taboos -the demonization of reality, chaos and consumption -are pivotal in understanding Russia's stance in global climate politics. The strengthened authoritarian stance presumably indicates that the 'negative sacred' has also gained force in recent years; constraining government effort to justify political decisions to domestic and international audiences (Gel'man 2016; Pomerantsev 2014).

In dealing with existential dangers, it is therefore not enough to accept moderate probabilities for the defence of human rights even if 100 percent certainty about future events can never be achieved [1]. Consequently, ambitious climate protection with drastic GHG reductions is required. Discussion and Conclusions Several empirical indications have shown that current global GHG budget calculations are unduly generous.

In this context, there is a growing interest in exploring plants to find new natural antioxidants to prevent the appearance and the development of these muscle disorders. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant properties of Arctium lappa leaves in a model of primary human muscle cells exposed to H2O2 oxidative stress. We identified using bioassay-guided purification, onopordopicrin, a sesquiterpene lactone as the main molecule responsible for the antioxidant activity of A. lappa leaf extract. According to our findings, onopordopicrin inhibited the H2O2-mediated loss of muscle cell viability, by limiting the production of free radicals and abolishing DNA cellular damages. Moreover, we showed that onopordopicrin promoted the expression of the nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) downstream target protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in muscle cells. By using siRNA, we demonstrated that the inhibition of the expression of Nrf2 reduced the protective effect of onopordopicrin, indicating that the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway mediates the antioxidant effect of onopordopicrin in primary human muscle cells. Therefore, our results suggest that onopordopicrin may be a potential therapeutic molecule to fight against oxidative stress in pathological specific muscle disorders.

Fourth, it saves a large proportion of the oil benefits in a sovereignty fund for future generations and economic downturns.

In dealing with existential dangers, it is therefore not enough to accept moderate probabilities for the defence of human rights even if 100 percent certainty about future events can never be achieved [1].

In this context, there is a growing interest in exploring plants to find new natural antioxidants to prevent the appearance and the development of these muscle disorders. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant properties of Arctium lappa leaves in a model of primary human muscle cells exposed to H2O2 oxidative stress. We identified using bioassay-guided purification, onopordopicrin, a sesquiterpene lactone as the main molecule responsible for the antioxidant activity of A. lappa leaf extract. According to our findings, onopordopicrin inhibited the H2O2-mediated loss of muscle cell viability, by limiting the production of free radicals and abolishing DNA cellular damages. Moreover, we showed that onopordopicrin promoted the expression of the nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) downstream target protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in muscle cells. By using siRNA, we demonstrated that the inhibition of the expression of Nrf2 reduced the protective effect of onopordopicrin, indicating that the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway mediates the antioxidant effect of onopordopicrin in primary human muscle cells. Therefore, our results suggest that onopordopicrin may be a potential therapeutic molecule to fight against oxidative stress in pathological specific muscle disorders.

Similarly, Sandip Mishra (2016) explains ecocriticism to be \"an earth centric approach to literary studies which promotes the understanding of who we are, where we stand, how we should behave with our mother nature etc.\" (p. 169). In addition, ecocriticism has focused on two things: dedicating itself to defending and taking care of the natural world, and establishing a relationship between the human and non-human world. It also raises human's awareness of the environmental problems which are a result of man's abuse (p. 168). Furthermore, Camilo Gomides (2006) demonstrates the field of ecocriticism addresses works of literature focusing on the moral aspect of human beings' interaction with nature besides showing readers what could take place in the future.

Second, it extracts maximum royalties and benefits for the Norwegian people from private oil companies by having a state-owned oil company to leverage royalties from competing private-sector companies. Third, it implements a high-carbon tax throughout its economy to reduce carbon-polluting activities and stimulate low-carbon innovation. Fourth, it saves a large proportion of the oil benefits in a sovereignty fund for future generations and economic downturns. Parenthetically, it borrowed this idea from Alberta, but whereas Norway saved massive amounts in it, Alberta didn't because its right-wing leaders refused to form its own state oil company and government involvement. Norway's economic practices result in taking maximum benefits for its citizens so that the least amount of oil need be extracted and combusted. This contrasts with other crude oil exporting states whose prosperity depends on volume: extracting as much crude oil as possible. They then suffer the boom-and-bust cycles of the market. Fifth, Norway built efficient systems of low-carbon rapid public transportation and heating. Sixth, it spends part of its oil revenue to offset emissions, principally by financing reforestation in Indonesia, Brazil, and other countries.

These culturalpolitical approaches, emphasizing the role of culture and political economy, inform the contextualizing approach we adopt here. Rossiiskaya We understand climate change denial discourse in a way that includes both the rejection of the theory that climate is changing as a result of anthropogenic emissions, and that this process may also bring negative societal and environmental effects, along with the idea that this phenomenon should be addressed by redefining the political agenda. Thus, denialist discourse can take the form of outright dismissal of the anthropogenic climate change theory, and emphasize either that the climate is not warming or that the climate is cooling instead. Another denialist viewpoint includes accepting that the climate might be warming, but that this has natural origins (the Sun, changes in the Earth's orbit, for example) and that all that governments and nations can do is adapt to the phenomenon; there are no grounds to implement mitigation measures. This is a relatively clear framing of the climate issue. Denial discourse also includes a midway position that Wilson Rowe (2009, p. 598) describes as 'causally agnostic': climate change might be of anthropogenic origin, but the issue cannot be resolved by scientific means. In Russia, this agnostic position seemed, from the early to the mid-2000s, to mean accepting, without further scientific evidence, that mitigation measures were justified regardless of the origin of climate change. Politically, this tallies with what Henry and MacIntosh Sundstrom (2012) described as Medvedev's (2008-12) modernization agenda effect: climate mitigation was considered as\n[2] policy that would demand immediate costs and delayed benefits. That being said, the blame does not fall on politicians alone.Individuals have failed to make the necessary sacrifices that would reduce personal emissions.It is no secret that human behaviors have caused irreparable damage to the biosphere, yet persistent inaction betrays an atmosphere of feigned ignorance.On the surface, the response-or lack thereof-to climate change reflects either an inherent deficiency in the moral sense, or some widespread moral decline.Morality plays a major role in the way we understand climate change, but environmental apathy is not borne from immorality.In order to properly understand the issue, it is essential to unwrap the role of the moral sense in the decision-making process.In doing so, it becomes evident that it is not a lack of morality that has caused our failure to implement comprehensive global climate change reform.Rather, humanity's inability to reconcile its relational sense of morality with the unprecedented scale of climate change bears the blame. The philosophical and theological notion of morality is couched in an abstract notion of divine perfection.Consequently, immorality can be understood as deviation from divine perfection.In contrast, anthropologist Alan Fiske explores morality by studying relationships.Fiske found that moral beliefs across cultures could be categorized into four relational models. 3The relational models classify the myriad of social interactions that elicit moral sentiment, and they unpack the evolutionary basis of moral norms.The first model, communal sharing, reflects the open exchange of resources within a group.The second model, authority-ranking, encourages morality through linear hierarchies. 4The third model, equality-matching, views morality\n[3] climate change is left primarily to political leeway (for example, due to the conflicting liberties of businesses and consumers). Nevertheless, the political scope for decision-making ends where political action or inaction endangers the liberal democratic order as such (for interpretation rules, see also,75). This is precisely the effect that inadequately mitigated climate change could have,25,26,71. For this reason, an ambitious climate policy is imperative from a human rights perspective and includes addressing that societal transformation toward a 1.5 \u2022 C warmer world does not exacerbate poverty and vulnerability or creates new inequities but promotes equitable change,140. This is further underlined by the precautionary principle as a general principle of international law. Precaution means taking measures in view of long-term, cumulating, or uncertain damages,. The precautionary principle does not fully prohibit the pursuit of an action, which bears the chance of causing irreversible harm (since precaution also implies balancing different risks and opportunities, and even daily life entails irreversible risks), but shows a tendency in this direction in light of huge risks. Climate change exceeding the target of Art. 2 para. 1 PA will lead to such irreversible negative consequences globally and therefore needs to be mitigated. Even if some dispute the role of the precautionary principle in general,147, the principle is clearly codified on several levels in national, EU, and international law, i.e., Art. 3 para. 3 UNFCCC, Art. 191 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Art. 20a of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). Moreover, precaution is\n[4] that refutational learning is a more effective way to acquire knowledge than are conventional techniques (97). CONCLUSION Communication by scientists and their allies by itself will not move climate mitigation forward. As sociologist Robert Brulle and colleagues (24) noted, \"[The barriers to action on climate change are based in the distribution of social power in the economic, political, and cultural spheres. Introducing new messages or information into an otherwise unchanged socioeconomic system will accomplish little\" (p. 185). But socioeconomic and political systems are not impervious to change. A Swedish school girl taught the world that lesson in 2019. SUMMARY POINTS 1. Climate change challenges our cognitive abilities and the worldviews of many. 2. Because addressing climate change has serious economic and political implications, any communication takes place in an environment of adversity. 3. Providing information about climate change, in particular about the scientific consensus and explanations of why it occurs, can enhance people's acceptance of science. 4. Culturally aligned messages and messengers are more likely to be successful. 5. Through a process known as inoculation, climate misinformation can be rebutted or, ideally, defanged before it is encountered.

What makes climate change pre-eminently a moral issue is that due to the inertia of the climatic system the bulk of impacts of climate change will clearly not be felt for another 50 years or more, when future generations will occupy this planet rather than present generations (Hansen 2005).In other words those creating the risks are not the same as those bearing them.With a few negligible exceptions, mitigation measures would therefore cost present generations more than they would benefit in the form of risk reduction.Or, in economic terms, few mitigation measures would survive an egocentric cost-benefit analysis by the present electorate.Future generations, by definition, have no direct say in presentday decision-making; they are not part of the present electorate.It is present generations that decide whether or not to improve the living conditions of future generations by mitigating climate change. Apart from this intergenerational shifting of costs, there is also intra-generational shifting, for each country holds that the benefits of fossil fuel use are reaped domestically, while the costs of climate change are diffused across the world.Although in principle the 'import' of climate costs might balance the 'export,' in practice it does not.As mentioned, in 2001 the United States emitted about 24% of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions (EIA 2004), while its population and land\n[6] We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.

This stereotype is exacerbated by a deeper understanding of gender roles. The attitudes of adult boys and girls to mathematics differ significantly [Etaugh, Liss, 1992, p. 133]. Hyde and his colleagues noticed that among students, boys, as opposed to girls, are more confident in math and see it as their own profession. Boys have been observed to convince their peers that mathematics is not appropriate for their gender roles and assume that they will fail in this area. Teenage girls, in order to please boys, do not want to pursue areas that are inappropriate for gender roles. Because it can negatively affect their attractiveness [Hyde, 1990, p. 303]. In general, women cannot be smarter than men due to their traditional gender roles. Because traditional gender stereotypes try to portray men as smart and women as stupid. Komarovsky's research showed that smart women try to portray themselves as less intelligent and infantile than men, so as not to achieve an image \"not for a woman.\" Because if they try to prove that they are smarter, they will be persecuted by traditional gender consciousness. Despite the overwhelming evidence that girls are as good at math as boys, they are less likely to become scientists or engineers.

This was confirmed by their own study of 77,602 eighth graders from 19 countries. The study found significant cross-cultural differences in gender differences in math skills. While in seven countries boys are better than girls (France, Israel, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Canada, Swaziland), in eight countries (British Columbia, England, Hong Kong, Japan, Nigeria, Scotland, Sweden, USA) gender no differences were found. In four countries, girls outpaced boys (Belgium, Finland, Hungary, Thailand). The authors associate these results with data reflecting declining gender disparities in mathematics in countries where opportunities for women are expanding, and argue that the overall picture contradicts biological models of cognitive difference, which puts social factors in second place after biological ones [Baker and Perkins-Jones, from. 97-98]. Selkow found that if gender role identification was controlled, gender differences could be reduced when solving math problems. In her experiments, she found that women with strong traditional gender-role identifications performed math problems worse than others (those with weak gender identifications). This once again showed that the gender role is great in the development and manifestation of mathematical abilities [Bern,.

This stereotype is exacerbated by a deeper understanding of gender roles. The attitudes of adult boys and girls to mathematics differ significantly [Etaugh, Liss, 1992, p. 133. Hyde and his colleagues noticed that among students, boys, as opposed to girls, are more confident in math and see it as their own profession. Boys have been observed to convince their peers that mathematics is not appropriate for their gender roles and assume that they will fail in this area. Teenage girls, in order to please boys, do not want to pursue areas that are inappropriate for gender roles. Because it can negatively affect their attractiveness [Hyde, 1990, p. 303. In general, women cannot be smarter than men due to their traditional gender roles. Because traditional gender stereotypes try to portray men as smart and women as stupid. Komarovsky's research showed that smart women try to portray themselves as less intelligent and infantile than men, so as not to achieve an image \"not for a woman.\" Because if they try to prove that they are smarter, they will be persecuted by traditional gender consciousness. Despite the overwhelming evidence that girls are as good at math as boys, they are less likely to become scientists or engineers.

This makes Clark work less important in contemporary scholarship. It is important to discuss his work here as his work did not go unchallenged for decades. For example, Thomas Wentworth Higginson pointed out that girls underachievement previously linked with the lack of opportunities and gendered and prejudiced culture (Hubbard, 1990). He further asserted that today girls have access and opportunities of getting education, so they are outperforming boys even after puberty. Thus menstruation does not affect their learning ability. Girls are dominating boys even in traditionally masculine subjects in industrialized countries. This gives a strong ground and base to argue that academic performance is rooted in socio-cultural forces instead of biology.

They believe that females become women through the process of socialization whereby they learn feminine traits and behaviours and males become men and learn masculine traits (Ullah, 2013). In the same fashion they believe that girls' underperformance in SETM is not due to girls' biology but is due to social environment and opportunities available to them.

From results gathered, it was obvious that while some other factors might contribute to the intelligence level of an individual, left handedness offers an additional advantage over right handedness. This can be said to be that left-handed individuals will be more intelligent in the areas of spatial and musical intelligence because they would have a large repository of control because this area is controlled by the hemisphere responsible for their left-handedness. Also, educational level and environment has a link with the intelligence of the individual. In fact, the IQ of an individual can be improved by training. That is, a left-handed individual can achieve giant strides academically because the asymmetry of the brain hemispheres gives him/her good coordination, retention, and memory.

They show that male students have better memory, so they can memorize vocabulary faster. As well as, the ability to think logically helps them learn better. A study in Sweden mentioned that boys do better in English than in other subjects in school. It could be that English has become associated with their hobbies and what they do in their free time, which motivates them more and makes them feel more confident when they come to school and have lessons in English compared to other subjects (Sara, 2018). There is only one opinion that gender does not affect studying. Achieving success in learning depends on each person's learning method. This corresponds to Noack's study (2016) Conclusion The current study explored students' self-efficacy beliefs in learning English. The study examined the relative strength between students' ability beliefs and their English performance (their English final test scores were used to measure their English performance). Gender differences in self-efficacy beliefs and English performance were also explored.

Gender issues are currently the main focus of discussion and research all over the world, Nigeria inclusive. The question of gender is a matter of grave concern especially among academics and policy formulators. Intellectuals are worried about the role of male and female in the psychological, political, social, economic, religious, scientific and technological development of nations. Meanwhile, concerns about academic achievement with respect to males and females have generated a considerable interest in the field of educational testing over the years. Differences in academic achievement of the two genders are likely to contribute disparities in the allocation of cognitive roles in the world of work. Numerous studies on sex differences in cognitive performance can be found. Colom and Lynn (2004) asserted that males have larger average brain sizes than females and therefore, would be expected to have higher average 1Qs. Mackintosh (1998) on the other hand, claims that there is no sex difference in general intelligence. Mackintosh proposes that general intelligence should be defined as reasoning ability and that the best measure of this is the progressive matrices. Examining two tests administered by the Israel Defense Forces which qualify as IQ tests-one of them is an adaptation of progressive matrices. Flynn (1998) found no sex difference. Investigating academic performance at pre-collegiate level, Lao (1980) found female students to obtain higher Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) compared to males.

Wilberg and Lynn (1999) arrived at a similar conclusion for history classes versus history tests. The authors explain this pattern by stating that females tend to work more conscientiously and have a stronger work ethic than males. They also tend to have better language abilities including essay writing skills, vocabulary and word fluency which contribute to better course work. Stage and Kloosterman (1995) noted that although gender differences in math achievement continue to exist on high cognitive level tasks at the high school level, such differences appear to be declining. Young and Fisler (2000) examining SAT-M scores of high school seniors, found males to score better than females. However, they noted that males generally come from households where the parents' socioeconomic status as measured by examinee reported educational levels and income, is higher. In contrast, female test takers are more diverse and include more low-income students than the boys group. Others have argued that the content of the test or of its administration favors males (Bridgemen & Wendler, 1991). Yet other researchers have explained the gap by adhering to such factors as differences in course taking behaviour, classroom experiences and processing (Young & Fisler, 2000). The studies conducted outside of the US present differing outcomes. Younger, Warrington and Williams (1999) focus on the gender gap in English secondary schools.

While in seven countries boys are better than girls (France, Israel, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Canada, Swaziland), in eight countries (British Columbia, England, Hong Kong, Japan, Nigeria, Scotland, Sweden, USA) gender no differences were found. In four countries, girls outpaced boys (Belgium, Finland, Hungary, Thailand). The authors associate these results with data reflecting declining gender disparities in mathematics in countries where opportunities for women are expanding, and argue that the overall picture contradicts biological models of cognitive difference, which puts social factors in second place after biological ones [Baker and Perkins-Jones, from. 97-98]. Selkow found that if gender role identification was controlled, gender differences could be reduced when solving math problems. In her experiments, she found that women with strong traditional gender-role identifications performed math problems worse than others (those with weak gender identifications).

Another controversial theory of biological differences between men and women is sociobiology theory. This theory states that genetic factors cause differences between male and female. Similarly, another focus of biological theories is physiological differences between male and female.

For example, Thomas Wentworth Higginson pointed out that girls underachievement previously linked with the lack of opportunities and gendered and prejudiced culture (Hubbard, 1990). He further asserted that today girls have access and opportunities of getting education, so they are outperforming boys even after puberty. Thus menstruation does not affect their learning ability. Girls are dominating boys even in traditionally masculine subjects in industrialized countries. This gives a strong ground and base to argue that academic performance is rooted in socio-cultural forces instead of biology.

Scarcella and Zimmerman (1998) also revealed that men performed better than women in the academic vocabulary recognition test. The studies of Lin and Wu (2003), Lynn et al.

Unlike foreign scholars, Sunderland (2000) showed that women had better performance than men in a memory test. On the other hand, the findings of Terrazas (2005-2008) revealed a non-significant gender difference in a receptive vocabulary performance test.

In identifying the role of gender in vocabulary learning strategies, Jimenez (2003) found that females were superior to males in qualitative and quantitative terms by using more strategies than males.

Meanwhile, concerns about academic achievement with respect to males and females have generated a considerable interest in the field of educational testing over the years. Differences in academic achievement of the two genders are likely to contribute disparities in the allocation of cognitive roles in the world of work. Numerous studies on sex differences in cognitive performance can be found.

Investigating academic performance at pre-collegiate level, Lao (1980) found female students to obtain higher Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) compared to males.

Wilberg and Lynn (1999) arrived at a similar conclusion for history classes versus history tests. The authors explain this pattern by stating that females tend to work more conscientiously and have a stronger work ethic than males. They also tend to have better language abilities including essay writing skills, vocabulary and word fluency which contribute to better course work. Stage and Kloosterman (1995) noted that although gender differences in math achievement continue to exist on high cognitive level tasks at the high school level, such differences appear to be declining. Young and Fisler (2000) examining SAT-M scores of high school seniors, found males to score better than females. However, they noted that males generally come from households where the parents' socioeconomic status as measured by examinee reported educational levels and income, is higher. In contrast, female test takers are more diverse and include more low-income students than the boys group. Others have argued that the content of the test or of its administration favors males (Bridgemen & Wendler, 1991). Yet other researchers have explained the gap by adhering to such factors as differences in course taking behaviour, classroom experiences and processing (Young & Fisler, 2000). The studies conducted outside of the US present differing outcomes. Younger, Warrington and Williams (1999) focus on the gender gap in English secondary schools.

Besides size, genders also differ in brain autonomy. Using brain mapping, researchers found that men have six times more gray matter connected to intelligence than women, but women have ten times more white matter. One study shows that genderrelated differences in brain areas connect with IQ (106). This study and others show that males' inferior parietal lobes are larger. This lobe helps boys with spatial and mathematical reasoning. The left side of the brain, which controls language and verbal and written skills, develops sooner in girls, so they perform better in those areas (107). These results concur with Mouza et al. (108) 's conclusion that male students have a higher cognitive level of CT knowledge than female students. In addition, other studies have found that female students have limited computing knowledge and experience (109). According The colored cells mean that the items colored were biased to gender. The values are not fulfilled the t-value (\u00b12.00) and the probability (Welch) (>0.05). to research, males are typically more interested in information or knowledge than females (110). This may be due to the influence of culture and stereotypical socialization processes experienced by people beginning in childhood, as there are more men than women in these sectors (61). Lack of early experience and other obstacles contribute to girls' underrepresentation in this field (111). Examining the affective construct, findings indicate that male students are more interested in practicing CT than female students for items A4 (I want to learn\n[1] area. This stereotype is exacerbated by a deeper understanding of gender roles. The attitudes of adult boys and girls to mathematics differ significantly [Etaugh, Liss, 1992, p. 133. Hyde and his colleagues noticed that among students, boys, as opposed to girls, are more confident in math and see it as their own profession. Boys have been observed to convince their peers that mathematics is not appropriate for their gender roles and assume that they will fail in this area. Teenage girls, in order to please boys, do not want to pursue areas that are inappropriate for gender roles. Because it can negatively affect their attractiveness [Hyde, 1990, p. 303. In general, women cannot be smarter than men due to their traditional gender roles. Because traditional gender stereotypes try to portray men as smart and women as stupid. Komarovsky's research showed that smart women try to portray themselves as less intelligent and infantile than men, so as not to achieve an image \"not for a woman.\" Because if they try to prove that they are smarter, they will be persecuted by traditional gender consciousness. Despite the overwhelming evidence that girls are as good at math as boys, they are less likely to become scientists or engineers. Baker and Perkins-Jones determined that the secret of a student's success in a particular subject lies in a pre-planned specialty. Eccles found that after eighth grade girls included less mathematics in their future plans and, naturally, were less prepared to participate in the selection in mathematics [Eccles, 1989, p. 41. Baker\n[2] (2017) asserted that females are better in verbal and theoretical learning and therefore they do not select STEM subjects because they lack mathematical reasoning. Girls lack better cognitive skills which are important in STEM subjects and that's why they fall behind in STEM education (Ceci & Williams, 2011). Another controversial theory of biological differences between men and women is sociobiology theory. This theory states that genetic factors cause differences between male and female. Similarly, another focus of biological theories is physiological differences between male and female. Followers of physiological differences believe that biological differences differently affect the behaviour of men and women. Men are physically stronger than women which enables them (men) to see the world in a better way than women in terms of ideas and reasoning. Geiger et al., (2015) argued that women are sluggish, passive and uninterested in politics because of their biology. On the other hand, men are energetic, eager and interested in politics because of their biology. Another main argument of biological theories is that sex differences and biology affect learning and working ability. Girls' menstruation and physique intervene with their studies. In line with this, Clark related reasoning and learning abilities of women with their menstruation. Hubbard in his book \"The politics of women's biology\" citing Clark Blickenstaff, (2005) writes: \"There have been instances, and I have seen such, of females, in whom the special mechanism we are speaking of remained germinal,-undeveloped. It seemed to have been aborted.

There are some things boys tend to be better at than girls and vice versa.There is a skill superiority already built into general male and female brain development.Boy's occipital lobes are more developed, allowing them to see better in brighter light.Boys also require more movement when learning.The female brain is more decentralized.Female brains have a greater ability to multitask because their cerebrum is more active.Women use a variety of parts of their brains when they do a single task.The female brain is more integrated with more complex connections between both hemispheres.Thought and emotion are more complex than in the male brain.Women can think logically and emotionally at the same time.Other tests have claimed that females are superior in language, verbal fluency, speed of articulation and grammar, also arithmetic calculation.Their perceptual speed, for example in matching items is better, and so is their manual precision.Males are reckoned to be better at tasks that are spatial in nature, such as maze performance and mental rotation tasks, mechanical skills, mathematical reasoning and finding their way through a route.Women generally can recall lists of words or paragraphs of text better than men.Imaging studies of the living brain indicate that in women neurons on both\n[4] viewed as people of lesser importance in the society. Still, others view them as nothing more than ordinary. This research serves as an eye opener into the correlation between handedness and intelligence. The first hypothesis stated that it was expected that male left-handers will be more intelligent than female left-handers. The result gives reasons to believe that this is true as the analysis shows that it is significant. The result from the data gathered showed that more of the male heft-handers, about 35%, have abilities that the females don't have when it comes to activities like working with computers and calculators, mathematics, drawing and map reading sports, musical instruments, etc. The second hypothesis stated that individuals with higher educational level were expected to perform better than those with lower educational level. In Steinberg's findings, he stated that IQ is influenced by the length of time a person passed through school and so is indirectly means that education affects the level of intelligence even among lefthanders. Further on this, Murphy observed that most IQ differences that are of concern are those that are well within the normal range and might be systematically modified by optimal structuring of the learning environment. In view of the foregoing, it could be concluded safely that the educational level of individuals really does have a part to play when it comes to their performance. The third hypothesis stated that it is expected that lefthanders will be more intelligent in areas of spatial and musical abilities than right-handers. This, in fact is what\n[5] study, children were shown a picture of a man and a woman and then told to \"point to the most intelligent one.\" Four-and -years-old tend to choose their own sex, but by age six and beyond girls are more likely to choose the man [ .

False stereotypes about intelligence can derail girls' interest in math and science by first grade. these stereotypes, they are more likely to avoid math and science, while boys' interests in these subjects are encouraged and supported. Over time, these are the kinds of subtle biases that give rise to the under-representation of women in science. Gender biases in science continue through high-school and college. For example, in one study, researchers mailed fake applications to science teachers who were hiring a lab manager to help with daily activities in the laboratory-a coveted position for young scientists [ . Lab manager positions often help students get into competitive graduate and medical school programs. In the study, the fake applications were identical except for a single word at the top of the page-the first name of the student was randomly chosen\n[6] several vocabulary learning issues.

Furthermore, maximum of 17% reduction in the emissions were recorded in April 2020 based on the emission data only which reduced to~12% in the mid-June due to partial upliftment of the restrictions in some of the countries. However, as per the 2020 fullyear estimation data for CO 2 emissions, a total 7% and 8% decline was observed in contrast with the estimated data in 2019 by IEA 2020 and Enerdata 2020 reports, respectively (Programme UNE, 2020). Thus, the restrictions in mobility to limit the transmission of COVID-19 substantially influence the emission levels globally. For a fact, it is very difficult to predict the long-run effects of COVID-19 on GHG emissions throughout the world considering the rapid mutations in virus and how the extent of vaccination will bring the pandemic under control (Gautam and Hens, 2020).

The noteworthy increase in the emission rate was aided by the incremented combustion of fossil-fuels altogether by 0.9% in 2019 leading to the 12% enhancement in CO 2 and CH 4 emission along with 50% increased F-gas emission.

In a pandemic of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, it is important to consider the economic impacts of both such pandemics and global warming at the same time. One of the unique features of the COVID-19 pandemic is extreme and widespread disruption to the global economy when compared to other global pandemics, such as the 1918 Influenza Pandemic (\"Spanish Flu\") or the Hong Kong Flu of 1968 5 . On the official government website of the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States (see BEA (2020)), it was reported on September 30, 2020 that the real gross domestic product (GDP) decreased at an annual rate of 31.4% in the second quarter of 2020. According to a news report on September 2, 2020 in The Japan Times (2020), Japan's April-June GDP is expected to be revised after making an annualized 27.8% drop on a preliminary basis, which is the largest contraction in the post-World War II period. Though, at the time of revision of this paper, the reported drop of the real GDP in the United States in 2020 (compared to 2019) is only\n[1] The COVID-19 crisis and its consequences for global warming and climate change The coronavirus disease outbreak was a moment of unprecedented global change in which the regular pattern of life of hundreds of millions of people around the world was disrupted. To prevent the spread of this virus, governments halted many economic activities so that people would sequester at home. The decline in the consumption of petroleum and other fossil fuels has led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions which resulted in things that most living people had never before witnessed. Another consequence of coronavirus disease is a slight deceleration of global warming. The First-quarter 2020 global daily CO2 emissions from surface transport, power, and industry fell by 36%, 7.4%, and 19%, respectively, relative to the annual mean daily emissions in 2019. If they grow accustomed to these adjustments, oil consumption is likely to decline and investment in oil extraction will no longer be profitable. This radical interruption of the global economic system has made a serious move toward a greener economy. If governments have been able to undertake measures to control COVID-19 transmission, they are undoubtedly capable of changing the sources of energy production and energy consumption habits. 13 For decades, scientists have been calling for severe commitments to activities that will reduce the rate of global warming. As oil prices fall, governments have opportunities to implement carbon-emission reduction policies, make direct investments in renewable energy production, and promote a transition to cleaner energy. Coronavirus pandemic's impact on the oil industry have reduced greenhouse\n[2] can result in large transient regional climate response lasting about 5 years, possibly extending to decades. An unexpected result of this study is that reduction of carbon dioxide emissions for only 2 in 31 simulation years resulted in statistically significant cooler global MSTs for the whole period. However, the emission reductions were greatly exaggerated. Studies more specific to the coronavirus pandemic of 2019 have examined specific climate responses. Yang et al. (2020) considered fast climate responses caused by abrupt reductions of aerosols in a model with prescribed sea surface temperatures and sea ice concentrations, finding surface warming over continental regions of the Northern Hemisphere in 2020. Gettelman et al. (2020) found that while the peak impact of the sharp drop in aerosol emissions on global surface temperature was very small (+0.03 K), the aerosol changes were the largest contribution to COVID-19 emissions induced temperature changes, dominating CO 2 effects in 2020. Forster et al. (2020) estimated that while the reduction in global sulfur dioxide emission RAN ET AL. 10.1029/2021EF002061 would cause short-term warming, the long-term effect of the pandemic-driven response would be negligible, with a cooling of around 0.01\u00b0C \u00b1 0.005\u00b0C by 2030 compared to a baseline scenario that follows current national policies. In this study, emissions of aerosols and concentrations of CO 2 were returned to their original trajectories after two years. In reality, the economic crisis may require an extended recovery. In a more complex scenario, different regions may react differently, and hence the patterns of aerosol emissions may change from prior to the\n[3] and forced quarantine, would have affected global warming values by reducing the mean temperature values. Our results showed that the largest difference in the short-term temperature in terms of comparison to 2020 referred to the months when the quarantine began, that is, February and March, and the temperature was cooler in comparison to the prior years. The long-term mean assessment highlighted that the temperatures throughout the South American continent remained consistent during the first part of 2020 in comparison to the 30-year average data, but temperatures in North America declined from February to April. Similarly, the temperatures in Europe and Asia in April were lower compared to the last 30 years average data in February and March. Also, the average temperature of the Earth dropped about 0.3\u00b0C compared to 2019. Based on the results, there was an approximately 0.2\u00b0C decrease in average temperature in early 2020. If the lockdown persists, this decrease can grow to about 0.4\u00b0C in late 2020 and continue over 2021. On a short term and long-term scale, temperature variations based on the COVID-19 expansion were more pronounced in North America, Europe, and Asia. In contrast, minimal temperature changes occurred respectively in Australia, Africa, and South America. Considering that future analysis during the coming years must be also conducted, we hypothesize that the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on human activities could manifest different temperature trends over the world. These changes could be different considering diverse spatial scales (from regional to country scales), but observing these results, this unforeseen phenomena could represent a new\n[4] such a decline in global emissions have not been observed in the past 25 years. This decrease in global emissions might have consequences for the entire planet, causing a possible cooling effect. However, this depends upon the already accumulating concentrations of carbon dioxide and other atmospheric greenhouse gases. There are also possibilities that the reduced emissions will peak again after the global lockdown is lifted, and greater than before when factories and businesses attempt to balance their losses through increased activities. As a result of this remarkable decrease in emissions, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have opened new avenues in climaterelated research. While the growing impacts of climate change have long demanded a reduction in global emissions, this pandemic has lowered global emissions more successfully than ever in the past. Many countries, including Pakistan, have taken precautionary measures and introduced emergency reforms to combat this pandemic. However, it is uncertain whether this pandemic will help reduce long term carbon emissions and hence cause a cooling effect, or the world will bounce back to its previous emission concentrations (Sheikh, 2020). There are many things that countries can gleam from their battle against the COVID-19 virus and incorporate them into the fight against climate change. Further, it has urged the global communities to ponder about having frequent socio-economic lockdown in areas with more carbon emissions in order to meet the set targets of the Paris agreement.

From Fig. 3, the trends in GHG emissions by six major emitters namely, China, United States, European Union, India, the Russian Federation, and Japan which contributed 26%, 13%, 9%, 7%, 5% and 3% of total 62% of the collective GHG emission, respectively. Typically, European Union (\u22123.8%), United States (\u22122.8%), and Japan (\u22122.1%) showed a slight decrease in GHG emission and partially counterbalanced an increase in GHG emission mainly by China, India, and Russian Federation. The noteworthy increase in the emission rate was aided by the incremented combustion of fossil-fuels altogether by 0.9% in 2019 leading to the 12% enhancement in CO 2 and CH 4 emission along with 50% increased F-gas emission. However, the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in 2019 not only drastically threatens human health, but also affected the global GHG emissions (Bai et al., 2020). During the pandemic most the countries implemented stringent measures like lockdowns in order to control its spread. Such measures have had substantial effects on global economy, and consequently on emissions throughout the world. Of note, it was very difficult to observe the real time change in energy\n[8] these studies, Guti\u00e9rrez-Hern\u00e1ndez and Garc\u00eda 34 argue that evidence of climate influences on COVID-19 is not robust enough to be considered in public health policies. There is negligible evidence that climate change will directly or substantively affect COVID-19 transmission in the long term. There is, however, evidence of links between air pollution and COVID- 19 Coinciding risks of climatic extremes and COVID-19 Globally, the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic intersected with one of the hottest years on record (2020). 2020 and 2021 also had several extreme climatic events, including wildfires (eg, in Siberia, North America, and T\u00fcrkiye); hurricanes and tropical storms (eg, in Fiji and the Bay of Bengal); floods (eg, in southern China, Pakistan, and Germany); droughts (eg, in west USA); and heatwaves (eg, in Canada). Although not all of these events are directly attributable to climate change, trends in the intensity and frequency of some climate and weather extremes have been detected. The World Meteorological Organization and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change note a clear effect of anthropogenic climate change on many of these extreme events. 61,62 The people and communities with the highest exposure to climatic extremes have also experienced more infections of and deaths from COVID-19, 63-66 creating a double burden to affected individuals. Evidence of the interaction between climatic extremes and COVID-19 has only just begun to emerge, with several discernible potential links (eg, direct effects on livelihoods or indirect effects on maternal health and nutrition). Different types of inequalities are increasingly known to interact to exacerbate vulnerability to a range\n[9] SARS-CoV-2.Figure 3 below is the precipitation data table of Wuhan in June and July 2019 and in June and July 2020.As per the comparison of the precipitation in June and July of Wuhan in 2019 and 2020 in the above picture, the amount of precipitation in 2020 has dramatically increased, especially the precipitation in July 2020 was nearly nine times more than that in July 2019.It shows that owing to the impact of the epidemic, reducing carbon emissions will make the atmosphere circulate; the precipitation will increase, thus increasing the probability of floods. Summary The steps are done to manage Covid-19 have some shortterm indirect consequences on climate change.The long-term effect of Covid-19 on climate change is essentially nonexistent.People have focused on the Covid-19 outbreak and global climate change in the past three years.People are also grappling with the negative effects of climate change as well as the coronavirus pandemic.The pandemic has significantly increased greenhouse gas emissions, while the economic slowdown has decreased funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.This has developed a perfect storm of sorts, with the most vulnerable people and communities withstanding the worst impacts.The epidemic and climate change are both global concerns that necessitate a coordinated response; thus, they both need to be addressed immediately.The pandemic has demonstrated that we must be prepared for future shocks, and climate change is our biggest shock.The government must take action to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts.The epidemic has shown how crucial it is to be\n", "output": "The relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and global warming is complex and multifaceted. While the pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy and energy consumption, leading to a temporary reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, it is not the primary cause of global warming.\n\nGlobal warming, also known as climate change, is a long-term and ongoing process caused by the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which trap heat and lead to a rise in global temperatures [5]. The primary drivers of global warming are human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere [5].\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had some effects on global warming, but they are not sufficient to reverse the trend of global warming. The pandemic led to a significant decline in economic activity, which resulted in a temporary reduction in greenhouse gas emissions [1]. For example, a study by the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that the pandemic led to a 7.3% decrease in global CO2 emissions in 2020, compared to the previous year [7]. However, this reduction is not enough to offset the long-term trend of increasing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMoreover, the pandemic has also led to an increase in air pollution, which can exacerbate the negative impacts of climate change [8]. The mandatory lockdowns implemented during the pandemic have reduced the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and industry, but they have also led to an increase in air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation and heating [7].\n\nIn addition, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of international cooperation in addressing global challenges, including climate change. The pandemic has shown that the global community can come together to address a common threat, and there is a need for similar cooperation to address the challenge of climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, while the COVID-19 pandemic has had some effects on global warming, it is not the primary cause of global warming, and the pandemic's impact on greenhouse gas emissions is temporary and insufficient to reverse the trend of global warming [4]. Addressing climate change requires a long-term commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources, rather than relying on short-term solutions like the pandemic [5].", "initial_result": "The relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and global warming is complex and multifaceted.
