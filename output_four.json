This is consistent with the National Plan for Safety and Health Conditions at Work 2013-2021 (29), which set as one of its objectives to promote research for the early detection of risks to the health of workers and the implementation of timely interventions to reduce the incidence of occupational diseases. Conclusions Overweight is a prevalent condition in the study population (drivers), as well as lower aerobic capacity and more frequent musculoskeletal discomfort. The limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design, which does not allow establishing causal inferences; however, etiologic hypotheses were generated that encourage further research with more robust designs and, most importantly, provide guidance for making relevant public health decisions.

These findings indicate that the level of obesity would be a more significant correlate of MetS than the level of physical fitness. The males with low fatness and low fitness had relatively higher triglyceride level and higher number of abnormal values in MetS components than the males with low fatness and high fitness. In general, both the males and females with high fatness and low fitness were more likely to have higher number of abnormal values in MetS components than counterparts with high fatness and high fitness. We infer that people with a high degree of obesity may be greatly influenced by low physical fitness level which in turn increases the likelihood of abnormality in components of MetS. The study on mortality rates for cardiovascular disease associated with obesity and cardiopulmonary fitness with 21,925 males found that male adults with normal body weight and low cardiopulmonary fitness had 2.94 times higher mortality rates than those with normal body weight and high cardiopulmonary fitness. The study also found that obese males with low cardiopulmonary fitness had 4.11 times higher mortality rate by cardiovascular disease than obese males with high cardiopulmonary fitness. These findings concluded that both the level of obesity and cardiopulmonary fitness level were strongly related with the cardiovascular disease mortality. Another study examining the relationship between cardiopulmonary fitness, obesity and the prevalence of diabetes among 6,249 females found that females with\n[1] total fitness level (lower 50th percentile) were more likely to have abnormal values in all five components of MetS and increased prevalence of MetS as compared to those with the high total fitness level (upper 50th percentile). Table 5 presents a comparison of the mean values of muscular endurance (the number of sit-up performed, high number: high fit) and cardiopulmonary fitness (1-minute post exercise hear rate, low beat: high fit) by a level of HbA1c. In males, those with the high HbA1c level (> 5.5) had significantly lower muscular endurance and cardiopulmonary fitness than counterparts with the low HbA1c level (\u2264 5.5). In females, those with the high HbA1c level had significantly lower muscular endurance and higher cardiopulmonary fitness than counterparts with low HbA1c level. After adjusting for age, males with the high HbA1c level had significantly lower level of cardiopulmonary fitness than those with the low HbA1c level. Table 6 shows the relative risks for abnormality in five components of MetS, having one or more abnormal values in five components and a development of MetS across the combined levels of obesity and physical fitness. Males with the higher level of obesity and lower level of fitness were significantly more likely to have abnormality in BP (3.04 times), FBG (3.40 times) and TG (4.34), one or more abnormal value of five components (15.79 times) and a prevalence of Mets (5.26 times) as compared to males with the lower level of obesity and higher level of fitness. Effects of obesity and Fitness on HbA1c and MetS In\n[2] decreased in all groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such deterioration in physical fitness factors negatively affected body composition, immunocytes, cytokines, and inflammatory protein. The results of this study were similar to the results of other studies in that the physical fitness improved when exercise was performed. In contrast, the improved levels of physical fitness returned to baseline levels or worsened when training was stopped. Cardiorespiratory endurance is the most basic element of health-related fitness. Muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility are also important for health, but these factors are most effective when the cardiopulmonary system is strong. The role of removing waste products by supplying nutrients and oxygen to body tissues depends on the ability of the lungs, heart, and vessels. All human beings can respond or adapt to physical needs only when they are in good physical condition. Regular physical training increases the efficiency of the heart, from which a large amount of blood is drawn per heart rate, and increases the VO 2 max. On the other hand, when training is discontinued, which occurred for many people due to social distancing measures, the efficiency of the cardiopulmonary system decreases, and VO 2 max is reduced. A study by Costill et al. showed that aerobic capacity decreases by 10-15% when endurance athletes stop training for a week, while Fox et al. indicated a period of 4 to 8 weeks to lose most of the benefits obtained from physical training, including changes in muscle enzyme activity and function. According to Saltin and Rowell, the\n[3] Is Cardiopulmonary Fitness Level a Risk Factor in Young Saudi Females Low physical fitness is one of the all-cause mortality risk factors. This study aims to estimate cardiopulmonary fitness (VO 2 max) in young Saudi females and correlate it to anthropometric and hemodynamic parameters. Forty-eight young Saudi females completed an exercise stress test until exhaustion. Basal and maximum pulse rate, arterial blood pressure, VO 2 max and other anthropometric data were measured. The population was divided into low and high VO 2 max groups and a comparison was run using student t -test. Correlation was tested between VO 2 max and other measured parameters. The mean VO 2 max of the sample population was low (33.6 \u00b1 8.2 mL/ (kg\u00b7min) with 37.5% exhibiting fair to very poor VO 2 max value. The low VO 2 max group was characterized by higher body mass index, exercise diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure when compared to normal VO 2 max group, indicating a strong negative correlation. This study revealed a low cardiopulmonary fitness in young Saudi females and showed a strong association between VO 2 max and increased body fat and maximum exercise diastolic blood pressure. These findings provide reliable indicators of increased all-cause mortality risk in young Saudi females and increase the urgency of prompt action. Introduction P hysical inactivity is one of the major risk factors that threaten the public health . Recent epidemiological studies demonstrated a signifi cant impact of moderate physical activity on lowering the incidence of all vascular diseases including coronary vascular,\n[4] females with compromised cardiopulmonary status. Studies have shown that there is a linear increase in heart rate and a curvilinear change in dyspnea, with an increase in exercise intensity during ISWT making it more likely to reveal symptoms during the ISWT. Stepwise linear regression revealed that ISWD had strong positive correlation with age (r 0.739), weak positive correlation with height (r = 0.412) and gender (r = 0.342). These parameters explain 68% of the variance seen in ISWD. Vanessa et al. (2012) and Jurgensen et al. (2010) have observed stronger correlation with BMI, which was not observed in our model. This may reflect the fact that fitness is considered to be independent of fatness, though low levels of fitness and high levels of fatness increase mortality from all causes. Recent evidence suggests no further increase in the predictive value of equations utilizing lean body mass. The clinical relevance of our study is evident, as increasing the utilization of ISWT makes it necessary to establish reference values. The strength of the study lies in the large sample size (862 subjects) and wide age group (17-75 years), which allow for a major percentage of subjects who might suffer from cardiopulmonary disorders. An understanding of the physiological responses demonstrated by healthy people in different age groups would aid in evaluating responses in age-matched afflicted people. The performance of afflicted people can be presented as percentiles or absolute values, or compared with predicted values using the reference equation [Tables 5 and 6. Easily measurable variables such\n[5] until the age of 27 and then declined, and that of women rose until the age of 20 and then declined 7) . Especially the drastic decline of pulmonary function starts after the age of 60, so it has been known that even though a person enjoys normal health condition, he can suffer from dyspnea occurring frequently while engaging in some exercises 8) . Consequentially, many research papers show close relativity between age and pulmonary function 9) . However, well-known prediction formula of pulmonary function test includes weight and height in addition to age 10) . In general, a decline of cardiopulmonary function causes decrease of basal metabolic rate, which can be one reason for obesity 11) . In turn, obesity can increase risk of cardiovascular disease 12) , hence, weight can be one of the influential factors for cardiopulmonary function. Kim et al. 5) confirmed the relationship between weight and cardiopulmonary function in the study of senior high school male students. The relationship between height and cardiopulmonary function can be referred in the study conducted by Rode and Shephard 13) . The Caucasian Americans and the Inuit subjects featured relatively short height, and the study concluded that the Inuit had similar pulmonary function with tall height Americans since the Inuit had well developed upper body. Namely, this study shows that the pulmonary function is relatively proportionate to one's height, however, the well-developed upper body can affect the pulmonary function as well. Per contra, most of the studies were conducted with young age subjects, so it\n[6] postoperative outcome. Patients with cardiopulmonary fitness below the recommended cut-points are susceptible to postoperative complications and mortality.\n[7] Rioux et al.

The role of removing waste products by supplying nutrients and oxygen to body tissues depends on the ability of the lungs, heart, and vessels.

The role of removing waste products by supplying nutrients and oxygen to body tissues depends on the ability of the lungs, heart, and vessels.

Regular physical training increases the efficiency of the heart, from which a large amount of blood is drawn per heart rate, and increases the VO 2 max.

Muscle strength is an important factor for health, as well as movements for all sports activities. Physical fitness training expands muscle tissue to increase relative adaptive capacity, while exercise capacity decreases when muscle strength weakens. According to Graves et al.

In general, both the males and females with high fatness and low fitness were more likely to have higher number of abnormal values in MetS components than counterparts with high fatness and high fitness. We infer that people with a high degree of obesity may be greatly influenced by low physical fitness level which in turn increases the likelihood of abnormality in components of MetS.

The study also found that obese males with low cardiopulmonary fitness had 4.11 times higher mortality rate by cardiovascular disease than obese males with high cardiopulmonary fitness. These findings concluded that both the level of obesity and cardiopulmonary fitness level were strongly related with the cardiovascular disease mortality. Another study examining the relationship between cardiopulmonary fitness, obesity and the prevalence of diabetes among 6,249 females found that females with\n[1] total fitness level (lower 50th percentile) were more likely to have abnormal values in all five components of MetS and increased prevalence of MetS as compared to those with the high total fitness level (upper 50th percentile). Table 5 presents a comparison of the mean values of muscular endurance (the number of sit-up performed, high number: high fit) and cardiopulmonary fitness (1-minute post exercise hear rate, low beat: high fit) by a level of HbA1c. In males, those with the high HbA1c level (> 5.5) had significantly lower muscular endurance and cardiopulmonary fitness than counterparts with the low HbA1c level (\u2264 5.5). In females, those with the high HbA1c level had significantly lower muscular endurance and higher cardiopulmonary fitness than counterparts with low HbA1c level. After adjusting for age, males with the high HbA1c level had significantly lower level of cardiopulmonary fitness than those with the low HbA1c level. Table 6 shows the relative risks for abnormality in five components of MetS, having one or more abnormal values in five components and a development of MetS across the combined levels of obesity and physical fitness. Males with the higher level of obesity and lower level of fitness were significantly more likely to have abnormality in BP (3.04 times), FBG (3.40 times) and TG (4.34), one or more abnormal value of five components (15.79 times) and a prevalence of Mets (5.26 times) as compared to males with the lower level of obesity and higher level of fitness. Effects of obesity and Fitness on HbA1c and MetS In\n[2] Is Cardiopulmonary Fitness Level a Risk Factor in Young Saudi Females Low physical fitness is one of the all-cause mortality risk factors. This study aims to estimate cardiopulmonary fitness (VO 2 max) in young Saudi females and correlate it to anthropometric and hemodynamic parameters. Forty-eight young Saudi females completed an exercise stress test until exhaustion. Basal and maximum pulse rate, arterial blood pressure, VO 2 max and other anthropometric data were measured. The population was divided into low and high VO 2 max groups and a comparison was run using student t -test. Correlation was tested between VO 2 max and other measured parameters. The mean VO 2 max of the sample population was low (33.6 \u00b1 8.2 mL/ (kg\u00b7min) with 37.5% exhibiting fair to very poor VO 2 max value. The low VO 2 max group was characterized by higher body mass index, exercise diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure when compared to normal VO 2 max group, indicating a strong negative correlation. This study revealed a low cardiopulmonary fitness in young Saudi females and showed a strong association between VO 2 max and increased body fat and maximum exercise diastolic blood pressure. These findings provide reliable indicators of increased all-cause mortality risk in young Saudi females and increase the urgency of prompt action. Introduction P hysical inactivity is one of the major risk factors that threaten the public health . Recent epidemiological studies demonstrated a signifi cant impact of moderate physical activity on lowering the incidence of all vascular diseases including coronary vascular,\n[3] females with compromised cardiopulmonary status. Studies have shown that there is a linear increase in heart rate and a curvilinear change in dyspnea, with an increase in exercise intensity during ISWT making it more likely to reveal symptoms during the ISWT. Stepwise linear regression revealed that ISWD had strong positive correlation with age (r 0.739), weak positive correlation with height (r = 0.412) and gender (r = 0.342). These parameters explain 68% of the variance seen in ISWD. Vanessa et al. (2012) and Jurgensen et al. (2010) have observed stronger correlation with BMI, which was not observed in our model. This may reflect the fact that fitness is considered to be independent of fatness, though low levels of fitness and high levels of fatness increase mortality from all causes. Recent evidence suggests no further increase in the predictive value of equations utilizing lean body mass. The clinical relevance of our study is evident, as increasing the utilization of ISWT makes it necessary to establish reference values. The strength of the study lies in the large sample size (862 subjects) and wide age group (17-75 years), which allow for a major percentage of subjects who might suffer from cardiopulmonary disorders. An understanding of the physiological responses demonstrated by healthy people in different age groups would aid in evaluating responses in age-matched afflicted people. The performance of afflicted people can be presented as percentiles or absolute values, or compared with predicted values using the reference equation [Tables 5 and 6. Easily measurable variables such\n[4] postoperative outcome. Patients with cardiopulmonary fitness below the recommended cut-points are susceptible to postoperative complications and mortality.\n[5] decreased in all groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such deterioration in physical fitness factors negatively affected body composition, immunocytes, cytokines, and inflammatory protein. The results of this study were similar to the results of other studies in that the physical fitness improved when exercise was performed. In contrast, the improved levels of physical fitness returned to baseline levels or worsened when training was stopped. Cardiorespiratory endurance is the most basic element of health-related fitness. Muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility are also important for health, but these factors are most effective when the cardiopulmonary system is strong. The role of removing waste products by supplying nutrients and oxygen to body tissues depends on the ability of the lungs, heart, and vessels. All human beings can respond or adapt to physical needs only when they are in good physical condition. Regular physical training increases the efficiency of the heart, from which a large amount of blood is drawn per heart rate, and increases the VO 2 max. On the other hand, when training is discontinued, which occurred for many people due to social distancing measures, the efficiency of the cardiopulmonary system decreases, and VO 2 max is reduced. A study by Costill et al. showed that aerobic capacity decreases by 10-15% when endurance athletes stop training for a week, while Fox et al. indicated a period of 4 to 8 weeks to lose most of the benefits obtained from physical training, including changes in muscle enzyme activity and function. According to Saltin and Rowell, the\n[6] until the age of 27 and then declined, and that of women rose until the age of 20 and then declined 7) . Especially the drastic decline of pulmonary function starts after the age of 60, so it has been known that even though a person enjoys normal health condition, he can suffer from dyspnea occurring frequently while engaging in some exercises 8) . Consequentially, many research papers show close relativity between age and pulmonary function 9) . However, well-known prediction formula of pulmonary function test includes weight and height in addition to age 10) . In general, a decline of cardiopulmonary function causes decrease of basal metabolic rate, which can be one reason for obesity 11) . In turn, obesity can increase risk of cardiovascular disease 12) , hence, weight can be one of the influential factors for cardiopulmonary function. Kim et al. 5) confirmed the relationship between weight and cardiopulmonary function in the study of senior high school male students. The relationship between height and cardiopulmonary function can be referred in the study conducted by Rode and Shephard 13) . The Caucasian Americans and the Inuit subjects featured relatively short height, and the study concluded that the Inuit had similar pulmonary function with tall height Americans since the Inuit had well developed upper body. Namely, this study shows that the pulmonary function is relatively proportionate to one's height, however, the well-developed upper body can affect the pulmonary function as well. Per contra, most of the studies were conducted with young age subjects, so it\n[7] Rioux et al. (20), in which obese men achieved an average of -7cm, being much less than the results found in this research. On the other hand, the distance traveled and the maximum oxygen consumption, as defined during the Submaximal 2-km treadmill test, in overweight and obese subjects was lower in overweight and obese subjects than in those with normal BMI. These findings have also been reported in other studies, where people with a BMI >25.3 kg/m 2 have very low exercise tolerance due to altered cardiopulmonary function caused by an increased fat mass that interferes with the aerobic response to physical exertion. (21,22) Modifiable risk factors, overweight, obesity and sedentary lifestyle expose the drivers to chronic non-communicable diseases, a condition that is reversed with high levels of physical activity. Other authors suggest that good cardiorespiratory fitness modifies the correlation between higher BMI and all-cause mortality (23), and that good physical fitness alters the obesity paradox, because BMI \u226525 can protect against premature mortality if the person has good physical fitness. (24) This study also found that overweight and obesity are associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as low back pain, a result reported by other authors as well. (25,26) In the study by Hussain et al. (25) a similar phenomenon between the ratio of BMI and lowback pain was found: higher levels of low-back pain were found in adult subjects with elevated BMI, while subjects with low BMI did not present these symptoms. Another study on work-related stress in heavy vehicle drivers of a transport company\n[8] and subsequent management for any abnormalities in cardiopulmonary function, given that various cancer therapies can injure the heart and lungs and lead to reduced cardiopulmonary function and fitness (94,95,(117)(118)(119), which associates with increased risk of long-term cardiovascular toxicities, cardiopulmonary symptoms, and mortality (120,121). Rehabilitation Too Late? Currently, the AHA has issued a Scientific Statement endorsing cardio-oncologic rehabilitation, including cardiopulmonary stress testing after patients have completed cancer therapy, particularly for those who received high doses of cardiotoxic chemotherapy or radiation and who have known cardiopulmonary symptoms, CVD, or untreated CVD risk factors (76). The statement is supported by various studies suggesting the benefit of structured exercise therapy for improving cardiovascular health and cardiopulmonary or fitness for cancer survivors (30,81,97,122). In turn, cardiopulmonary fitness associates with lower levels of shortterm and long-term cardiovascular and other toxicities, as well as a lower risk of mortality in individuals with cancer (94,120,121). Studies also indicate benefits of exercise prior to initiation of or during cancer therapy (30,116,123). The statement also encourages optimization of patient evaluation, nutrition and dietary counseling, obesity management, blood pressure and lipids management, diabetes, tobacco cessation, and management of psychosocial contributing factors (76). Additionally, the AHA statement encourages continued research to help determine best practices for implementation of cardio-oncology rehabilitation and determine of clinical indication and feasibility to support reimbursement. Perhaps once rehabilitation becomes more established, we can then also strategize and implement cardio-oncology prehabilitation and habilitation. Yet, will it be too late to wait? Should we primarily focus our efforts on rehabilitation after cancer therapies, or should\n", "output": "High cardiopulmonary fitness does not cause increased mortality rate.

Here, we have focused our studies on mutant-KRAS PDAC tumor models and utilized largely pharmacological interventions of KRAS/MEK and mTORC1/2, including the KRAS G12C inhibitor, AMG 510, together with biochemical analyses of signaling pathways, to uncover co-vulnerabilities and adaptive mechanisms leading to treatment resistance. We find that genetic silencing of KRAS in human PDAC tumor cells resulted in a rapid concomitant activation of AKT, resulting in tumor recurrence. Pharmacological inhibition of KRAS (G12C) as well as MEK also resulted in tumor recurrence after initial growth suppression and regression. The recurrence inevitably involved the activation of AKT as determined by AKT Ser-473 phosphorylation. We have identified a pathway involving ILK and Rictor in the activation of AKT via mTORC2 in response to the inhibition of either KRAS or MEK. These data demonstrate that acute suppression of the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway results in rapid activation of the mTORC2 signaling pathways, leading to enhancement of tumor cell growth and survival.

Furthermore, our results show that, although pSK6 and p4E-BP1 are suppressed in response to MEK inhibition, other AKT substrates, notably FOXO3a ( Figure S1D), are activated, suggesting a specific effect of KRAS and MEK inhibition on the mTORC1 signaling axis, similar to previous studies in KRAS mutant lung cancer showing that inhibition of KRAS G12C with ARS1620 results in inhibition of pS6K. 34 Interestingly, inhibition of mTORC1 and 2 complexes with potent inhibitors, such as Torin 1 or AZD2014, resulted in acute stimulation of ERK phosphorylation, as has been observed previously by others, 29 and treatment of multiple PDAC tumors with Torin 1 alone had very limited effect on tumor growth in vivo. These data demonstrate that tumor cell plasticity and rapid adaptation to stress result in the activation of compensatory signaling pathways that allow the tumor cells to continue to grow and survive if either KRAS/MEK or mTORC1/2 are inhibited individually.

Inhibitors of the SHP2 phosphatase 14 have also been recently demonstrated to inhibit non-small cell lung as well as MIA PaCa-2 PDAC tumor growth in combination with an inhibitor of KRAS, although a detailed analysis of whether this combination is effective in multiple PDAC models with activated KRAS/ MEK has not been determined. Here, we have focused our studies on mutant-KRAS PDAC tumor models and utilized largely pharmacological interventions of KRAS/MEK and mTORC1/2, including the KRAS G12C inhibitor, AMG 510, together with biochemical analyses of signaling pathways, to uncover co-vulnerabilities and adaptive mechanisms leading to treatment resistance. We find that genetic silencing of KRAS in human PDAC tumor cells resulted in a rapid concomitant activation of AKT, resulting in tumor recurrence. Pharmacological inhibition of KRAS (G12C) as well as MEK also resulted in tumor recurrence after initial growth suppression and regression. The recurrence inevitably involved the activation of AKT as determined by AKT Ser-473 phosphorylation. We have identified a pathway involving ILK and Rictor in the activation of AKT via mTORC2 in response to the inhibition of either KRAS or MEK. These data demonstrate that acute suppression of the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway results in rapid activation of the mTORC2 signaling pathways, leading to enhancement of tumor cell growth and survival.

PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors In addition to the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, PI3K is the second effector pathway that is also activated by KRAS. GTP-bound KRAS stimulates PI3Ks to convert phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which contributes to the recruitment of AKT to the cell membrane where it becomes phosphorylated and then activates mTOR. Therefore, inhibition of this pathway at each node may be an optional approach for the treatment of KRAS-mutant tumors. However, most monotherapies targeting PI3K, AKT, and/or mTOR are ineffective in KRAS-mutant cancer [116]. PI3K pathway inhibitors are more suitable as an option in combination therapy for KRAS-mutant cancers, because there are overlapping feedback mechanisms between the MAPK and PI3K pathways, meaning that inhibition of one pathway can result in the compensatory activation of the other [111,117,118]. Therefore, the combination of MAPK and PI3K inhibitors may be a compelling regimen for the treatment of KRAS-mutant cancers. In KRAS-mutant CRC cell lines, PI3K pathway inhibitors overcome resistance to MEK inhibitors and significantly inhibit cell proliferation.

Therefore, the combination of PI3K inhibitors and other inhibitors that we mentioned in this Review, especially KRAS G12C covalent inhibitors, may be a potential treatment strategy for KRAS-mutant CRC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors Blockade of the immune checkpoint axis, such as targeting PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) or its receptor PD-1, has induced striking regressions in various malignancies. Several antibodies targeting immune checkpoint proteins have been approved by FDA and achieved a favorable clinical effect in many cancers. However, most patients with CRC, except for those with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR), cannot therapeutically benefit from immunotherapies because they have low immunogenicity [125][126][127]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that KRAS-mutant CRC have significantly reduced infiltration of na\u00efve B cells, macrophage M1, activated CD4 T cells, cytotoxic cells and neutrophils, and obviously increased regulatory T cells compared to patients with KRAS wild-type CRC [128,129]. Besides, multiple immune-related pathways are down-regulated in KRAS-mutant CRC, such as the interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) pathway [129]. Therefore, these results may indicate that KRAS-mutant CRC harbor a more immunosuppressive microenvironment, which significantly limits the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy in this group of CRC patients.

In addition, they promote the expression of cell-cycle inhibitors, p21 Cip1 , p27 Kip1 , and p15, and induce cell-cycle arrest (25). Recently, FOXO proteins were reported to have a critical role in drug resistance. The inhibition of FOXO3a induced resistance to anticancer therapeutics, not only to a MEK inhibitor but also to gefitinib and doxorubicin (26,27). FOXO3a activity is also frequently attenuated in drug-resistant cancer cells (25). Thus, the control of FOXO activity by increasing nuclear localization is a promising strategy for overcoming drug resistance. Using the above arguments as a rationale, we focused on using FOXOs as a potential therapeutic target to overcome the resistance to MEK inhibitor trametinib. In our previous LKB1 study, we showed that MEK resistance was due to the presence of LKB1 and relocalization of FOXOs (22). In this study, we searched for drug candidates to enhance the activity of transcription factor FOXOs against RAS-mutated lung cancer cells with wild-type LKB1. Some well-known targeted agents were reported to promote the transcription factor activity of FOXO proteins. HDAC inhibitors were identified to activate E2F1/ FOXO transcription and enhanced E2F1-induced apoptosis though the FOXO3-dependent pathway in human osteosarcoma cells (28).

Furthermore, our results show that, although pSK6 and p4E-BP1 are suppressed in response to MEK inhibition, other AKT substrates, notably FOXO3a ( Figure S1D), are activated, suggesting a specific effect of KRAS and MEK inhibition on the mTORC1 signaling axis, similar to previous studies in KRAS mutant lung cancer showing that inhibition of KRAS G12C with ARS1620 results in inhibition of pS6K. 34 Interestingly, inhibition of mTORC1 and 2 complexes with potent inhibitors, such as Torin 1 or AZD2014, resulted in acute stimulation of ERK phosphorylation, as has been observed previously by others, 29 and treatment of multiple PDAC tumors with Torin 1 alone had very limited effect on tumor growth in vivo.

PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors In addition to the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, PI3K is the second effector pathway that is also activated by KRAS. GTP-bound KRAS stimulates PI3Ks to convert phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which contributes to the recruitment of AKT to the cell membrane where it becomes phosphorylated and then activates mTOR. Therefore, inhibition of this pathway at each node may be an optional approach for the treatment of KRAS-mutant tumors. However, most monotherapies targeting PI3K, AKT, and/or mTOR are ineffective in KRAS-mutant cancer [116]. PI3K pathway inhibitors are more suitable as an option in combination therapy for KRAS-mutant cancers, because there are overlapping feedback mechanisms between the MAPK and PI3K pathways, meaning that inhibition of one pathway can result in the compensatory activation of the other [111,117,118].

Immune checkpoint inhibitors Blockade of the immune checkpoint axis, such as targeting PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) or its receptor PD-1, has induced striking regressions in various malignancies. Several antibodies targeting immune checkpoint proteins have been approved by FDA and achieved a favorable clinical effect in many cancers. However, most patients with CRC, except for those with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR), cannot therapeutically benefit from immunotherapies because they have low immunogenicity [125][126][127].

Besides, multiple immune-related pathways are down-regulated in KRAS-mutant CRC, such as the interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) pathway [129]. Therefore, these results may indicate that KRAS-mutant CRC harbor a more immunosuppressive microenvironment, which significantly limits the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy in this group of CRC patients.

In addition, they promote the expression of cell-cycle inhibitors, p21 Cip1 , p27 Kip1 , and p15, and induce cell-cycle arrest (25). Recently, FOXO proteins were reported to have a critical role in drug resistance. The inhibition of FOXO3a induced resistance to anticancer therapeutics, not only to a MEK inhibitor but also to gefitinib and doxorubicin (26,27). FOXO3a activity is also frequently attenuated in drug-resistant cancer cells (25). Thus, the control of FOXO activity by increasing nuclear localization is a promising strategy for overcoming drug resistance. Using the above arguments as a rationale, we focused on using FOXOs as a potential therapeutic target to overcome the resistance to MEK inhibitor trametinib. In our previous LKB1 study, we showed that MEK resistance was due to the presence of LKB1 and relocalization of FOXOs (22). In this study, we searched for drug candidates to enhance the activity of transcription factor FOXOs against RAS-mutated lung cancer cells with wild-type LKB1. Some well-known targeted agents were reported to promote the transcription factor activity of FOXO proteins. HDAC inhibitors were identified to activate E2F1/ FOXO transcription and enhanced E2F1-induced apoptosis though the FOXO3-dependent pathway in human osteosarcoma cells (28).

They found that combination treatment with PD98059 and rapamycin suppressed the proliferation of CRC cells, induced apoptosis, arrested cell cycle and reduced the incidence and volume of CRC in mice. They also demonstrated that combined administration of these two drugs was able to inhibit the phophorylation of mTOR and MEK signaling pathways and were significantly more effective than single agent treatment [33]. mTOR consists of two functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 has been shown to regulate cell growth", "retrieval next text": "by controlling mRNA translation initiation and to regulate ribosome biogenesis, autophagy and lipid biosynthesis [34]. mTORC2 on the other hand is involved in cell survival and proliferation through phosphorylation of AKT and protein kinase C [35]. mTORC1 has been shown to be sensitive to acute exposure to rapamycin while mTORC2 was not. Thus, ATP competitive inhibitors that target both mTOR complexes have been developed.

For patients with BRAF mutant tumors, the results suggest that the addition of a RAF inhibitor to a MEK inhibitor may delay or overcome drug resistance. Recently, the Wnt pathway was identified as a potential mediator of resistance to the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib in tumors harboring BRAF mutation. Concomitant use of selumetinib and cyclosporine, inhibited tumor growth and caused tumor regression in patient derived tumor xenografts.

They found that combination treatment with PD98059 and rapamycin suppressed the proliferation of CRC cells, induced apoptosis, arrested cell cycle and reduced the incidence and volume of CRC in mice.

Because of the absence of paradoxical activation and the resistance to single MEK inhibitors for RAS-mutant tumors, MEK inhibitors are considered candidates for combination in RAS-mutant tumors and have exhibited feasible antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. For example, co-targeting of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-XL or MCL-1 and MEK promotes tumor regression in KRAS-mutant tumor models compared with MEK targeting alone,145. Serine threonine phosphatase PP2A inhibition could confer MEK inhibitor resistance in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells. Moreover, combined insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and MEK blockade showed significant effects in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells and in KRASdriven mice tumor models. Combined treatment with poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and MEK inhibitors elicited synergistic effects in vitro and in vivo in multiple RAS mutant tumor models. Remarkably, a phase II study of docetaxel and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) in NSCLC patients with KRAS mutation exhibited a 33% RR and a median survival of 11.1 months. KRAS mutations may alter the expression of immune inhibitory molecules or immune cell infiltration, which indicates that MAPK signaling may have an impact on immune therapy,59. Combination of MEK inhibition and PD1/PD-L1 blockade prolonged OS of a KRAS-driven lung cancer model. In addition, combining MEK inhibitors with agonist antibodies targeting the immunostimulatory CD40 receptor resulted in synergistic antitumor efficacy in KRAS-driven tumors. ERK inhibition The ERK inhibition strategy exhibits therapeutic potential against RAS-mutant, BRAF-mutant, BRAF-or MEKinhibitor resistant tumors. A novel molecule selectively targeting\n[1] Inhibitors of KRAS G12C have shown promise, but this mutation is only present in 2% to 4% of colorectal cancer. The success and prospective advantages of direct KRAS G12C specific inhibitors have reinvigorated this field. This revival has emphasized a focus on the molecular changes and key interactions associated with specific RAS mutations, and a need to understand adaptive responses to treatment (11). Alternative and compensatory strategies for treating RAS mut tumors involve complex RAS-mediated feedback loop and compensatory signal transduction mechanisms. While inhibition of MEK has not been effective in vivo, rational combinations have been proposed based on synergistic pathways. One such combination involves cyclindependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, which block the transition from the G 1 to S-phase of the cell cycle by interfering with RB (12). It was previously shown that the combination of MEK and CDK4/6 inhibition might inhibit the growth benefit of KRAS mut induction in a genetically engineered melanoma mouse model based on synthetic lethal extinction (13). Within this same vein of thought, we and others previously reported that combining a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) with CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib) resulted significant synergy in inhibiting KRAS mut colorectal cancer growth (14,15). However, robust preclinical work to understand the breadth of potential benefit across a population of colorectal cancer and potential predictors of response are needed. To address this gap, we have tested the breadth and duration of activity of the combination in a wide spectrum of patientderived xenografts (PDX) models and evaluated novel mechanisms of resistance. These models benefit from maintaining the\n[2] (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT (alpha serine/threonineprotein kinase)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and RAF (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma)/MEK/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) have been targeted in several clinical trials in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, and as single agents they do not have significant activity (PFS 2 months and OS 5 months in second line setting). 114,115 Preclinical data suggest that MEK inhibitors may be active only in certain KRAS mutational subsets (KRAS V12 mutation and KRAS copy number variation-gains or loss, are resistant to MEK inhibitors). 116 Others suggest that MEK inhibitors alone or in combination with EGFR pathway inhibition may be effective in epithelial but not mesenchymal subtypes of pancreatic cancer. 117 Furthermore, MEK inhibitors alone result in feedback activation of the EGFR and PI3K pathways, thus combination strategies are expected to be more effective. 118 Indeed, MEK inhibitors in combination with gemcitabine have not demonstrated superior results vs gemcitabine alone in clinical trials, with PFS of 4-6 months and OS rates of 6-9 months, 119-121 but a subgroup of KRAS wild-type patients demonstrated higher than expected PFS and OS (9 and 18 months respectively). 121 Dual MEK and EGFR inhibition showed median PFS and OS of 2.6 and 7.5 months, respectively in the second line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. 122 The combination of PI3K/mTOR and MEK inhibitors is synergistic preclinically, 123 but clinical data to date show only modest activity when these pathways are concomitantly blocked (disease stabilization in 30%-50% of patients as best response, PFS and OS of 2 months and 5 months Drug Design, Development\n[3] suggest that distinct mechanisms may underpin these combination strategies and elucidation of such potential mechanistic differences constitutes an area of active future investigation. Inhibitors of the SHP2 phosphatase 14 have also been recently demonstrated to inhibit non-small cell lung as well as MIA PaCa-2 PDAC tumor growth in combination with an inhibitor of KRAS, although a detailed analysis of whether this combination is effective in multiple PDAC models with activated KRAS/ MEK has not been determined. Here, we have focused our studies on mutant-KRAS PDAC tumor models and utilized largely pharmacological interventions of KRAS/MEK and mTORC1/2, including the KRAS G12C inhibitor, AMG 510, together with biochemical analyses of signaling pathways, to uncover co-vulnerabilities and adaptive mechanisms leading to treatment resistance. We find that genetic silencing of KRAS in human PDAC tumor cells resulted in a rapid concomitant activation of AKT, resulting in tumor recurrence. Pharmacological inhibition of KRAS (G12C) as well as MEK also resulted in tumor recurrence after initial growth suppression and regression. The recurrence inevitably involved the activation of AKT as determined by AKT Ser-473 phosphorylation. We have identified a pathway involving ILK and Rictor in the activation of AKT via mTORC2 in response to the inhibition of either KRAS or MEK. These data demonstrate that acute suppression of the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway results in rapid activation of the mTORC2 signaling pathways, leading to enhancement of tumor cell growth and survival. Rictor and mTORC2 have been implicated in the progression of PDACs, 32 and Rictor expression is correlated with poor PDAC patient outcome. 33 Because\n[4] alone in KRAS-mutant CRC is not satisfactory. Therefore, the focus should be placed more on exploring the use of these inhibitors in combination with other inhibitors of the MAPK pathway or with other inhibitors that we mentioned in this Review, which may bring surprise for the treatment of KRAS-mutant CRC. PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors In addition to the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, PI3K is the second effector pathway that is also activated by KRAS. GTP-bound KRAS stimulates PI3Ks to convert phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which contributes to the recruitment of AKT to the cell membrane where it becomes phosphorylated and then activates mTOR. Therefore, inhibition of this pathway at each node may be an optional approach for the treatment of KRAS-mutant tumors. However, most monotherapies targeting PI3K, AKT, and/or mTOR are ineffective in KRAS-mutant cancer. PI3K pathway inhibitors are more suitable as an option in combination therapy for KRAS-mutant cancers, because there are overlapping feedback mechanisms between the MAPK and PI3K pathways, meaning that inhibition of one pathway can result in the compensatory activation of the other,117,118. Therefore, the combination of MAPK and PI3K inhibitors may be a compelling regimen for the treatment of KRAS-mutant cancers. In KRAS-mutant CRC cell lines, PI3K pathway inhibitors overcome resistance to MEK inhibitors and significantly inhibit cell proliferation. Moreover, this robust synergistic activity has also been observed in mouse models,119. However, in clinical trials, these combined treatment strategies appear to be ineffective in patients with KRAS-mutant CRC, which may be the result of dose limitation due to toxicity. Furthermore, upregulation of\n[5] belinostat and trametinib ( Fig. 4C and D). These results suggest that HDAC and MEK inhibition promoted the translocation of FOXO3a protein into the nucleus where it induced apoptosis in mouse xenograft tumors through the upregulation of BIM. Discussion Many promising drugs have been developed for NSCLC such as molecular targeted therapies for mutated EGFR and ALK translocations and immunotherapy. However, despite many years of research and the development of drugs that target various aspects of RAS biology, an effective treatment for RASmutant tumors still eludes us. A recent study has shown that KRAS G12C or G12V mutation subgroups tend to have some benefit when compared with other KRAS mutation groups in a phase II trial of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib plus docetaxel in KRAS-mutant NSCLC (20). The option of combining targeted therapies hitting different pathways is promising if we can balance toxicity with efficacy for use in the clinic. Combined therapy using PI3K/AKT and MEK inhibitors has activity in pre-clinical studies, but this activity seems relatively limited in clinical trials. For instance, the MTD of both AKT inhibitor MK-2206 and selumetinib could not achieve 70 % inhibition of their targets in colorectal tumors (21). Recently, we have demonstrated that LKB1-mutant tumors are sensitive to MEK inhibition irrespective of the RAS status. The mechanism appears to be through activation of the FOXO transcription factors, which regulate many cellular processes, including upregulation of BIM and apoptosis (22). When LKB1 is added back to the cells they become resistant to MEK inhibition due to the translocation of the\n[6] new MEK1/2 inhibitors such as GDC-0973 and RDEA119 have reduced activity in the brain, which may increase their therapeutic window. What are the most rationale and best combination therapies with MEK1/2 inhibitors? The multigenetic nature of advanced cancers suggests that MEK1/2 inhibitors will likely find their therapeutic utility in combination with other targeted agents or conventional cytotoxic drugs. Pre-clinical studies have shown that PI3K pathway activation, through PIK3CA activating mutations or PTEN loss of function, significantly decreases the response of KRAS mutant cancer cells to MEK1/2 inhibitors. Importantly, simultaneous inhibition of the ERK1/2 and PI3K pathways was found to exert a marked synergistic effect on tumor regression,103. These observations have provided a strong rationale for the combination of MEK1/2 and PI3K inhibitors in cancers that harbor concurrent activating mutations in these signaling pathways. In that context, Merck and AstraZeneca have recently announced their plan to collaborate in testing a combination therapy of AZD6244 and the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 in cancer. Finally, is the acquisition of resistance mutations in MEK1/MEK2 going to limit the clinical utility of these small molecule inhibitors? A recent study has reported the identification of a resistant MEK1 mutation in a metastatic tumor that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Therefore, it may prove necessary to target other components of the ERK1/2 pathway in patients who develop resistance or, eventually, to combine MEK1/2 inhibitors with Raf inhibitors to slow down the emergence of resistance. A phase I/II study of RDEA119 in combination with the multikinase Raf inhibitor\n[7] and KRAS mutations did not respond to therapy. These data suggest that tumors with both KRAS and phosphoinositide 3-kinase mutations are unlikely to respond to the inhibition of the MEK pathway alone or the PI3K pathway alone but will require effective inhibition of both MEK and PI3K/AKT pathway signaling. Tumor cells harboring the BRAF600E mutation have shown similar resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors \" Figure 1\" by increasing signaling through the ERK1/2 pathway due to amplification of the oncogene,22. For patients with BRAF mutant tumors, the results suggest that the addition of a RAF inhibitor to a MEK inhibitor may delay or overcome drug resistance. Recently, the Wnt pathway was identified as a potential mediator of resistance to the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib in tumors harboring BRAF mutation. Concomitant use of selumetinib and cyclosporine, inhibited tumor growth and caused tumor regression in patient derived tumor xenografts.

In addition, they promote the expression of cell-cycle inhibitors, p21 Cip1 , p27 Kip1 , and p15, and induce cell-cycle arrest (25). Recently, FOXO proteins were reported to have a critical role in drug resistance. The inhibition of FOXO3a induced resistance to anticancer therapeutics, not only to a MEK inhibitor but also to gefitinib and doxorubicin (26,27). FOXO3a activity is also frequently attenuated in drug-resistant cancer cells (25). Thus, the control of FOXO activity by increasing nuclear localization is a promising strategy for overcoming drug resistance. Using the above arguments as a rationale, we focused on using FOXOs as a potential therapeutic target to overcome the resistance to MEK inhibitor trametinib. In our previous LKB1 study, we showed that MEK resistance was due to the presence of LKB1 and relocalization of FOXOs (22). In this study, we searched for drug candidates to enhance the activity of transcription factor FOXOs against RAS-mutated lung cancer cells with wild-type LKB1. Some well-known targeted agents were reported to promote the transcription factor activity of FOXO proteins. HDAC inhibitors were identified to activate E2F1/ FOXO transcription and enhanced E2F1-induced apoptosis though the FOXO3-dependent pathway in human osteosarcoma cells (28).

PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors In addition to the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, PI3K is the second effector pathway that is also activated by KRAS. GTP-bound KRAS stimulates PI3Ks to convert phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which contributes to the recruitment of AKT to the cell membrane where it becomes phosphorylated and then activates mTOR. Therefore, inhibition of this pathway at each node may be an optional approach for the treatment of KRAS-mutant tumors. However, most monotherapies targeting PI3K, AKT, and/or mTOR are ineffective in KRAS-mutant cancer [116].

Immune checkpoint inhibitors Blockade of the immune checkpoint axis, such as targeting PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) or its receptor PD-1, has induced striking regressions in various malignancies. Several antibodies targeting immune checkpoint proteins have been approved by FDA and achieved a favorable clinical effect in many cancers. However, most patients with CRC, except for those with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR), cannot therapeutically benefit from immunotherapies because they have low immunogenicity [125][126][127].

Besides, multiple immune-related pathways are down-regulated in KRAS-mutant CRC, such as the interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) pathway [129].

Here, we have focused our studies on mutant-KRAS PDAC tumor models and utilized largely pharmacological interventions of KRAS/MEK and mTORC1/2, including the KRAS G12C inhibitor, AMG 510, together with biochemical analyses of signaling pathways, to uncover co-vulnerabilities and adaptive mechanisms leading to treatment resistance. We find that genetic silencing of KRAS in human PDAC tumor cells resulted in a rapid concomitant activation of AKT, resulting in tumor recurrence. Pharmacological inhibition of KRAS (G12C) as well as MEK also resulted in tumor recurrence after initial growth suppression and regression. The recurrence inevitably involved the activation of AKT as determined by AKT Ser-473 phosphorylation. We have identified a pathway involving ILK and Rictor in the activation of AKT via mTORC2 in response to the inhibition of either KRAS or MEK. These data demonstrate that acute suppression of the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway results in rapid activation of the mTORC2 signaling pathways, leading to enhancement of tumor cell growth and survival.

Furthermore, our results show that, although pSK6 and p4E-BP1 are suppressed in response to MEK inhibition, other AKT substrates, notably FOXO3a ( Figure S1D), are activated, suggesting a specific effect of KRAS and MEK inhibition on the mTORC1 signaling axis, similar to previous studies in KRAS mutant lung cancer showing that inhibition of KRAS G12C with ARS1620 results in inhibition of pS6K. 34 Interestingly, inhibition of mTORC1 and 2 complexes with potent inhibitors, such as Torin 1 or AZD2014, resulted in acute stimulation of ERK phosphorylation, as has been observed previously by others, 29 and treatment of multiple PDAC tumors with Torin 1 alone had very limited effect on tumor growth in vivo. These data demonstrate that tumor cell plasticity and rapid adaptation to stress result in the activation of compensatory signaling pathways that allow the tumor cells to continue to grow and survive if either KRAS/MEK or mTORC1/2 are inhibited individually.

Here, we have focused our studies on mutant-KRAS PDAC tumor models and utilized largely pharmacological interventions of KRAS/MEK and mTORC1/2, including the KRAS G12C inhibitor, AMG 510, together with biochemical analyses of signaling pathways, to uncover co-vulnerabilities and adaptive mechanisms leading to treatment resistance. We find that genetic silencing of KRAS in human PDAC tumor cells resulted in a rapid concomitant activation of AKT, resulting in tumor recurrence. Pharmacological inhibition of KRAS (G12C) as well as MEK also resulted in tumor recurrence after initial growth suppression and regression. The recurrence inevitably involved the activation of AKT as determined by AKT Ser-473 phosphorylation. We have identified a pathway involving ILK and Rictor in the activation of AKT via mTORC2 in response to the inhibition of either KRAS or MEK. These data demonstrate that acute suppression of the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway results in rapid activation of the mTORC2 signaling pathways, leading to enhancement of tumor cell growth and survival. Rictor and mTORC2 have been implicated in the progression of PDACs, 32 and Rictor expression is correlated with poor PDAC patient outcome. 33 Because", "title": ""}, {"id": "51294", "source": "pes2o_v2", "retrieval text": "and MEK inhibitors led to marked synergistic tumor regression in KRAS-mutant mouse lung tumors.

In addition, they promote the expression of cell-cycle inhibitors, p21 Cip1 , p27 Kip1 , and p15, and induce cell-cycle arrest (25). Recently, FOXO proteins were reported to have a critical role in drug resistance. The inhibition of FOXO3a induced resistance to anticancer therapeutics, not only to a MEK inhibitor but also to gefitinib and doxorubicin (26,27). FOXO3a activity is also frequently attenuated in drug-resistant cancer cells (25). Thus, the control of FOXO activity by increasing nuclear localization is a promising strategy for overcoming drug resistance. Using the above arguments as a rationale, we focused on using FOXOs as a potential therapeutic target to overcome the resistance to MEK inhibitor trametinib. In our previous LKB1 study, we showed that MEK resistance was due to the presence of LKB1 and relocalization of FOXOs (22). In this study, we searched for drug candidates to enhance the activity of transcription factor FOXOs against RAS-mutated lung cancer cells with wild-type LKB1.

Therefore, the focus should be placed more on exploring the use of these inhibitors in combination with other inhibitors of the MAPK pathway or with other inhibitors that we mentioned in this Review, which may bring surprise for the treatment of KRAS-mutant CRC. PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors In addition to the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, PI3K is the second effector pathway that is also activated by KRAS. GTP-bound KRAS stimulates PI3Ks to convert phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which contributes to the recruitment of AKT to the cell membrane where it becomes phosphorylated and then activates mTOR. Therefore, inhibition of this pathway at each node may be an optional approach for the treatment of KRAS-mutant tumors. However, most monotherapies targeting PI3K, AKT, and/or mTOR are ineffective in KRAS-mutant cancer [116]. PI3K pathway inhibitors are more suitable as an option in combination therapy for KRAS-mutant cancers, because there are overlapping feedback mechanisms between the MAPK and PI3K pathways, meaning that inhibition of one pathway can result in the compensatory activation of the other [111,117,118]. Therefore, the combination of MAPK and PI3K inhibitors may be a compelling regimen for the treatment of KRAS-mutant cancers. In KRAS-mutant CRC cell lines, PI3K pathway inhibitors overcome resistance to MEK inhibitors and significantly inhibit cell proliferation. Moreover, this robust synergistic activity has also been observed in mouse models [117,119]. However, in clinical trials, these combined treatment strategies appear to be ineffective in patients with KRAS-mutant CRC, which may be the result of dose limitation due to toxicity [120][121][122].

However, most patients with CRC, except for those with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR), cannot therapeutically benefit from immunotherapies because they have low immunogenicity [125][126][127]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that KRAS-mutant CRC have significantly reduced infiltration of na\u00efve B cells, macrophage M1, activated CD4 T cells, cytotoxic cells and neutrophils, and obviously increased regulatory T cells compared to patients with KRAS wild-type CRC [128,129]. Besides, multiple immune-related pathways are down-regulated in KRAS-mutant CRC, such as the interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) pathway [129]. Therefore, these results may indicate that KRAS-mutant CRC harbor a more immunosuppressive microenvironment, which significantly limits the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy in this group of CRC patients.

Therefore, the focus should be placed more on exploring the use of these inhibitors in combination with other inhibitors of the MAPK pathway or with other inhibitors that we mentioned in this Review, which may bring surprise for the treatment of KRAS-mutant CRC. PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors In addition to the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, PI3K is the second effector pathway that is also activated by KRAS. GTP-bound KRAS stimulates PI3Ks to convert phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which contributes to the recruitment of AKT to the cell membrane where it becomes phosphorylated and then activates mTOR. Therefore, inhibition of this pathway at each node may be an optional approach for the treatment of KRAS-mutant tumors. However, most monotherapies targeting PI3K, AKT, and/or mTOR are ineffective in KRAS-mutant cancer. PI3K pathway inhibitors are more suitable as an option in combination therapy for KRAS-mutant cancers, because there are overlapping feedback mechanisms between the MAPK and PI3K pathways, meaning that inhibition of one pathway can result in the compensatory activation of the other,117,118. Therefore, the combination of MAPK and PI3K inhibitors may be a compelling regimen for the treatment of KRAS-mutant cancers. In KRAS-mutant CRC cell lines, PI3K pathway inhibitors overcome resistance to MEK inhibitors and significantly inhibit cell proliferation. Moreover, this robust synergistic activity has also been observed in mouse models,119. However, in clinical trials, these combined treatment strategies appear to be ineffective in patients with KRAS-mutant CRC, which may be the result of dose limitation due to toxicity.

Because of the absence of paradoxical activation and the resistance to single MEK inhibitors for RAS-mutant tumors, MEK inhibitors are considered candidates for combination in RAS-mutant tumors and have exhibited feasible antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. For example, co-targeting of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-XL or MCL-1 and MEK promotes tumor regression in KRAS-mutant tumor models compared with MEK targeting alone,145. Serine threonine phosphatase PP2A inhibition could confer MEK inhibitor resistance in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells. Moreover, combined insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and MEK blockade showed significant effects in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells and in KRASdriven mice tumor models. Combined treatment with poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and MEK inhibitors elicited synergistic effects in vitro and in vivo in multiple RAS mutant tumor models. Remarkably, a phase II study of docetaxel and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) in NSCLC patients with KRAS mutation exhibited a 33% RR and a median survival of 11.1 months. KRAS mutations may alter the expression of immune inhibitory molecules or immune cell infiltration, which indicates that MAPK signaling may have an impact on immune therapy,59. Combination of MEK inhibition and PD1/PD-L1 blockade prolonged OS of a KRAS-driven lung cancer model. In addition, combining MEK inhibitors with agonist antibodies targeting the immunostimulatory CD40 receptor resulted in synergistic antitumor efficacy in KRAS-driven tumors. ERK inhibition The ERK inhibition strategy exhibits therapeutic potential against RAS-mutant, BRAF-mutant, BRAF-or MEKinhibitor resistant tumors. A novel molecule selectively targeting\n[1] (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT (alpha serine/threonineprotein kinase)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and RAF (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma)/MEK/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) have been targeted in several clinical trials in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, and as single agents they do not have significant activity (PFS 2 months and OS 5 months in second line setting). 114,115 Preclinical data suggest that MEK inhibitors may be active only in certain KRAS mutational subsets (KRAS V12 mutation and KRAS copy number variation-gains or loss, are resistant to MEK inhibitors). 116 Others suggest that MEK inhibitors alone or in combination with EGFR pathway inhibition may be effective in epithelial but not mesenchymal subtypes of pancreatic cancer. 117 Furthermore, MEK inhibitors alone result in feedback activation of the EGFR and PI3K pathways, thus combination strategies are expected to be more effective. 118 Indeed, MEK inhibitors in combination with gemcitabine have not demonstrated superior results vs gemcitabine alone in clinical trials, with PFS of 4-6 months and OS rates of 6-9 months, 119-121 but a subgroup of KRAS wild-type patients demonstrated higher than expected PFS and OS (9 and 18 months respectively). 121 Dual MEK and EGFR inhibition showed median PFS and OS of 2.6 and 7.5 months, respectively in the second line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. 122 The combination of PI3K/mTOR and MEK inhibitors is synergistic preclinically, 123 but clinical data to date show only modest activity when these pathways are concomitantly blocked (disease stabilization in 30%-50% of patients as best response, PFS and OS of 2 months and 5 months Drug Design, Development\n[2] Inhibitors of KRAS G12C have shown promise, but this mutation is only present in 2% to 4% of colorectal cancer. The success and prospective advantages of direct KRAS G12C specific inhibitors have reinvigorated this field. This revival has emphasized a focus on the molecular changes and key interactions associated with specific RAS mutations, and a need to understand adaptive responses to treatment (11). Alternative and compensatory strategies for treating RAS mut tumors involve complex RAS-mediated feedback loop and compensatory signal transduction mechanisms. While inhibition of MEK has not been effective in vivo, rational combinations have been proposed based on synergistic pathways. One such combination involves cyclindependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, which block the transition from the G 1 to S-phase of the cell cycle by interfering with RB (12). It was previously shown that the combination of MEK and CDK4/6 inhibition might inhibit the growth benefit of KRAS mut induction in a genetically engineered melanoma mouse model based on synthetic lethal extinction (13). Within this same vein of thought, we and others previously reported that combining a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) with CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib) resulted significant synergy in inhibiting KRAS mut colorectal cancer growth (14,15). However, robust preclinical work to understand the breadth of potential benefit across a population of colorectal cancer and potential predictors of response are needed. To address this gap, we have tested the breadth and duration of activity of the combination in a wide spectrum of patientderived xenografts (PDX) models and evaluated novel mechanisms of resistance. These models benefit from maintaining the\n[3] belinostat and trametinib ( Fig. 4C and D). These results suggest that HDAC and MEK inhibition promoted the translocation of FOXO3a protein into the nucleus where it induced apoptosis in mouse xenograft tumors through the upregulation of BIM. Discussion Many promising drugs have been developed for NSCLC such as molecular targeted therapies for mutated EGFR and ALK translocations and immunotherapy. However, despite many years of research and the development of drugs that target various aspects of RAS biology, an effective treatment for RASmutant tumors still eludes us. A recent study has shown that KRAS G12C or G12V mutation subgroups tend to have some benefit when compared with other KRAS mutation groups in a phase II trial of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib plus docetaxel in KRAS-mutant NSCLC (20). The option of combining targeted therapies hitting different pathways is promising if we can balance toxicity with efficacy for use in the clinic. Combined therapy using PI3K/AKT and MEK inhibitors has activity in pre-clinical studies, but this activity seems relatively limited in clinical trials. For instance, the MTD of both AKT inhibitor MK-2206 and selumetinib could not achieve 70 % inhibition of their targets in colorectal tumors (21). Recently, we have demonstrated that LKB1-mutant tumors are sensitive to MEK inhibition irrespective of the RAS status. The mechanism appears to be through activation of the FOXO transcription factors, which regulate many cellular processes, including upregulation of BIM and apoptosis (22). When LKB1 is added back to the cells they become resistant to MEK inhibition due to the translocation of the\n[4] alone in KRAS-mutant CRC is not satisfactory. Therefore, the focus should be placed more on exploring the use of these inhibitors in combination with other inhibitors of the MAPK pathway or with other inhibitors that we mentioned in this Review, which may bring surprise for the treatment of KRAS-mutant CRC. PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors In addition to the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, PI3K is the second effector pathway that is also activated by KRAS. GTP-bound KRAS stimulates PI3Ks to convert phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which contributes to the recruitment of AKT to the cell membrane where it becomes phosphorylated and then activates mTOR. Therefore, inhibition of this pathway at each node may be an optional approach for the treatment of KRAS-mutant tumors. However, most monotherapies targeting PI3K, AKT, and/or mTOR are ineffective in KRAS-mutant cancer. PI3K pathway inhibitors are more suitable as an option in combination therapy for KRAS-mutant cancers, because there are overlapping feedback mechanisms between the MAPK and PI3K pathways, meaning that inhibition of one pathway can result in the compensatory activation of the other,117,118. Therefore, the combination of MAPK and PI3K inhibitors may be a compelling regimen for the treatment of KRAS-mutant cancers. In KRAS-mutant CRC cell lines, PI3K pathway inhibitors overcome resistance to MEK inhibitors and significantly inhibit cell proliferation. Moreover, this robust synergistic activity has also been observed in mouse models,119. However, in clinical trials, these combined treatment strategies appear to be ineffective in patients with KRAS-mutant CRC, which may be the result of dose limitation due to toxicity. Furthermore, upregulation of\n[5] and KRAS mutations did not respond to therapy. These data suggest that tumors with both KRAS and phosphoinositide 3-kinase mutations are unlikely to respond to the inhibition of the MEK pathway alone or the PI3K pathway alone but will require effective inhibition of both MEK and PI3K/AKT pathway signaling. Tumor cells harboring the BRAF600E mutation have shown similar resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors \" Figure 1\" by increasing signaling through the ERK1/2 pathway due to amplification of the oncogene,22. For patients with BRAF mutant tumors, the results suggest that the addition of a RAF inhibitor to a MEK inhibitor may delay or overcome drug resistance. Recently, the Wnt pathway was identified as a potential mediator of resistance to the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib in tumors harboring BRAF mutation. Concomitant use of selumetinib and cyclosporine, inhibited tumor growth and caused tumor regression in patient derived tumor xenografts. Combined Inhibition of MEK and mTOR Zhang et al. assessed the combination effect of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin on CRC cell lines. They found that combination treatment with PD98059 and rapamycin suppressed the proliferation of CRC cells, induced apoptosis, arrested cell cycle and reduced the incidence and volume of CRC in mice. They also demonstrated that combined administration of these two drugs was able to inhibit the phophorylation of mTOR and MEK signaling pathways and were significantly more effective than single agent treatment. mTOR consists of two functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 has been shown to regulate cell growth\n[6] new MEK1/2 inhibitors such as GDC-0973 and RDEA119 have reduced activity in the brain, which may increase their therapeutic window. What are the most rationale and best combination therapies with MEK1/2 inhibitors? The multigenetic nature of advanced cancers suggests that MEK1/2 inhibitors will likely find their therapeutic utility in combination with other targeted agents or conventional cytotoxic drugs. Pre-clinical studies have shown that PI3K pathway activation, through PIK3CA activating mutations or PTEN loss of function, significantly decreases the response of KRAS mutant cancer cells to MEK1/2 inhibitors. Importantly, simultaneous inhibition of the ERK1/2 and PI3K pathways was found to exert a marked synergistic effect on tumor regression,103. These observations have provided a strong rationale for the combination of MEK1/2 and PI3K inhibitors in cancers that harbor concurrent activating mutations in these signaling pathways. In that context, Merck and AstraZeneca have recently announced their plan to collaborate in testing a combination therapy of AZD6244 and the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 in cancer. Finally, is the acquisition of resistance mutations in MEK1/MEK2 going to limit the clinical utility of these small molecule inhibitors? A recent study has reported the identification of a resistant MEK1 mutation in a metastatic tumor that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Therefore, it may prove necessary to target other components of the ERK1/2 pathway in patients who develop resistance or, eventually, to combine MEK1/2 inhibitors with Raf inhibitors to slow down the emergence of resistance. A phase I/II study of RDEA119 in combination with the multikinase Raf inhibitor\n[7] suggest that distinct mechanisms may underpin these combination strategies and elucidation of such potential mechanistic differences constitutes an area of active future investigation. Inhibitors of the SHP2 phosphatase 14 have also been recently demonstrated to inhibit non-small cell lung as well as MIA PaCa-2 PDAC tumor growth in combination with an inhibitor of KRAS, although a detailed analysis of whether this combination is effective in multiple PDAC models with activated KRAS/ MEK has not been determined. Here, we have focused our studies on mutant-KRAS PDAC tumor models and utilized largely pharmacological interventions of KRAS/MEK and mTORC1/2, including the KRAS G12C inhibitor, AMG 510, together with biochemical analyses of signaling pathways, to uncover co-vulnerabilities and adaptive mechanisms leading to treatment resistance. We find that genetic silencing of KRAS in human PDAC tumor cells resulted in a rapid concomitant activation of AKT, resulting in tumor recurrence. Pharmacological inhibition of KRAS (G12C) as well as MEK also resulted in tumor recurrence after initial growth suppression and regression. The recurrence inevitably involved the activation of AKT as determined by AKT Ser-473 phosphorylation. We have identified a pathway involving ILK and Rictor in the activation of AKT via mTORC2 in response to the inhibition of either KRAS or MEK. These data demonstrate that acute suppression of the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway results in rapid activation of the mTORC2 signaling pathways, leading to enhancement of tumor cell growth and survival. Rictor and mTORC2 have been implicated in the progression of PDACs, 32 and Rictor expression is correlated with poor PDAC patient outcome. 33 Because\n[8] and MEK inhibitors led to marked synergistic tumor regression in KRAS-mutant mouse lung tumors. They later observed that an AKT inhibitor when combined with MEK inhibitors, failed to induce apoptosis in human lung cancer cells with mutant EGFR although these cells were sensitive to the combination of PI3K and MEK inhibitors. However, in our study, we investigated that the combination therapy of MEK inhibitors and AKT inhibitor has a strongly synergistic effect on both EGFR mutant (such as HCC827) and EGFR wildtype cell lines. There are several possible reasons to explain this difference. Firstly, we used an allosteric inhibitor MK2206 in our study and they used an AKT1/2 inhibitor. The AKT1/2 inhibitor may not be as effective in inhibiting the three known isoenzymes of AKT thus resulting in a negative feedback loop which interferes with the efficacy of the combination therapy. Secondly, as the effect of the AZD6244-MK2206 combination is drug ratio-dependent, it is possible that the single drug ratio used in Engleman's study might not be the optimal ratio to induce synergy. Nevertheless, the efficacy of the combined suppression of ERK and AKT in KRASmutated cell lines confirm the strategy of dual downstream target inhibition converging on a common effector pathway, as previously reported by She et al, Legrier et al, Engelman et al and Mordant et al. This combination strategy represents a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors resistant to targeted therapies used as single agents. In conclusion, our finding that the combination of AZD6244 and MK2206 results in a\n[9] Subtype-Specific MEK-PI3 Kinase Feedback as a Therapeutic Target in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Mutations in the KRAS oncogene are dominant features in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Because KRAS itself is considered \u201cundruggable,\u201d targeting pathways downstream of KRAS are being explored as a rational therapeutic strategy. We investigated the consequences of MAP\u2013ERK kinase (MEK) inhibition in a large PDA cell line panel. Inhibition of MEK activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase in an EGF receptor (EGFR)-dependent fashion and combinations of MEK and EGFR inhibitors synergistically induced apoptosis. This combinatorial effect was observed in the epithelial but not mesenchymal subtype of PDA. RNA expression analysis revealed predictors of susceptibility to the combination, including E-cadherin, HER3, and the miR200-family of microRNAs, whereas expression of the transcription factor ZEB1 was associated with resistance to the drug combination. Knockdown of HER3 in epithelial-type and ZEB1 in mesenchymal-type PDA cell lines resulted in sensitization to the combination of MEK and EGFR inhibitors. Thus, our findings suggest a new, subtype-specific, and personalized therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.

Macrophages exert important roles in cholesterol efflux and preventing atherosclerosis. Cholesterol efflux from atherosclerotic plaque is a featured function of macrophage, which is determined by two critical transporters on the membrane. One is ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), mainly interacting with cholesterol-deficient and phospholipiddepleted apolipoproteinA-I (apoA-I) complexes.

Macrophage counts in symptomatic carotid plaques are significantly increased and considered to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [2]. Moreover, macrophage phenotypes have been identified as important factors in atherosclerotic conditions [3]. Accordingly, macrophages in atherosclerotic plaque are divided as proand anti-inflammatory macrophages, with polarization phenotypes M1 and M2 macrophages respectively. Both the two kinds of macrophages are hallmarks of atherosclerotic lesions. M1 macrophages are the predominant phenotype in rupture-prone shoulder regions while M2 macrophages present more stable of atherosclerotic plaque and prevent foam cell formation [3,4]. It has been found that macrophages could alter their phenotypes and functions in response to certain stimulators or cytokines [5]. Thus, regulators to increase anti-inflammatory macrophages and decrease pro-inflammatory macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions are promising approaches to prevent atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and control a wide range of biological functions by base pair with specific mRNAs. Recent reports have identified specific miRNAs as major regulators of lipid homeostasis and anti-atherosclerosis; and the best-characteristic one is miRNA-33 (miR-33) [6].

Circulating levels of FGF21 are elevated in patients with atherosclerosis, macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, possibly due to a compensatory upregulation.

These hormone-like FGFs are involved in the regulation of diverse metabolic pathways. FGF15/19 controls cholesterol/bile acid synthesis. FGF23 modulates phosphate/vitamin D metabolism, whereas FGF21 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism [2]. Physiologically, FGF21 expression is markedly increased in response to fasting/starvation, and elevated FGF21 is a central mediator for fasting-induced fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis and for inducing growth hormone resistance [3,4]. Pharmacologically, therapeutic intervention with recombinant FGF21 counteracts obesity and its related metabolic disorders in both rodents and nonhuman primates, including reduction of adiposity and amelioration of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease [5]. Furthermore, FGF21 is the downstream target of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3, and a growing body of evidence suggests that the glucose-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of the PPAR\u03b3 agonists (thiazolidinediones [TZDs]) and the therapeutic benefits of the PPAR\u03b1 agonists (fenofibrates) on lipid profiles are mediated in part by induction of FGF21 [6,7].

Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a noncommunicable disorder that threatens human health because of its various complications. As of 2019, an estimated 463 million people worldwide suffered from DM. The number of individuals with DM is expected to continue to grow, reaching about 700 million by 2045 (International Diabetes Federation, Diabetes Atlas 9th edition). If not properly treated, DM is accompanied by multiple complications in the eyes, kidneys, nerves, coronary arteries, and cerebrovascular and peripheral blood vessels, resulting in significant illness and incurring huge costs medically and socioeconomically [1]. There are many antidiabetic medications available at present and some have proven beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system as well as giving glycemic control. However, they have several side effects, such as genital infection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and gastrointestinal discomfort with glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues. New compounds have been developed to overcome the side effects of existing drugs. Among several candidates used for this purpose, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has drawn much attention. This is a hormone produced mainly by the liver [2]. Physiologically, the production and secretion of FGF21 increase in response to stress in the body, acting as an adaptive response [3]. Administration of FGF21 for pharmacological purposes shows favorable multifaceted effects on metabolically important organs [4].

We have shown that in A549 cells exposed to TNF and/or IL1 , adiponectin reduces in dose-and time-dependent manner cytotoxic effects of TNF and IL1 improving cell viability and decreasing apoptosis [60].

MicroRNA-33 (miR-33), a novel non-coding RNA that coexpresses with sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), affects macrophage actions to prevent atherosclerosis. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an important regulator of lipid metabolism, especially for macrophage-related cholesterol export, but the mechanism is not fully studied. Interestingly, FGF21 has been evidenced to prevent atherosclerosis via inhibiting SREBP-2 expression. Therefore, we speculate that FGF21 may be a potential regulator for miR-33 with an aim of insight into novel anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms and research fields. Introduction Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by the deposition of excess lipids in the arterial intima. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) could counteract the pathogenic events by promoting cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) from the artery wall, which involves in a series of factors including macrophage or non-macrophage related cholesterol efflux, cell membrane bound transporters, plasma lipid acceptors, plasma proteins and enzymes, and hepatic cellular receptors [1]. Macrophages exert important roles in cholesterol efflux and preventing atherosclerosis. Cholesterol efflux from atherosclerotic plaque is a featured function of macrophage, which is determined by two critical transporters on the membrane. One is ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), mainly interacting with cholesterol-deficient and phospholipiddepleted apolipoproteinA-I (apoA-I) complexes. The other is ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) that mediates macrophage cholesterol efflux through interacting with spherical, cholesterol-containing alpha HDL particles [1]. Hence, increasing the two transporters on macrophages is critical to promoting RCT process and reversing atheroma.", "retrieval next text": "Inflammation response is of central importance for the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Macrophage counts in symptomatic carotid plaques are significantly increased and considered to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [2]. Moreover, macrophage phenotypes have been identified as important factors in atherosclerotic conditions [3]. Accordingly, macrophages in atherosclerotic plaque are divided as proand anti-inflammatory macrophages, with polarization phenotypes M1 and M2 macrophages respectively. Both the two kinds of macrophages are hallmarks of atherosclerotic lesions. M1 macrophages are the predominant phenotype in rupture-prone shoulder regions while M2 macrophages present more stable of atherosclerotic plaque and prevent foam cell formation [3,4]. It has been found that macrophages could alter their phenotypes and functions in response to certain stimulators or cytokines [5]. Thus, regulators to increase anti-inflammatory macrophages and decrease pro-inflammatory macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions are promising approaches to prevent atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and control a wide range of biological functions by base pair with specific mRNAs. Recent reports have identified specific miRNAs as major regulators of lipid homeostasis and anti-atherosclerosis; and the best-characteristic one is miRNA-33 (miR-33) [6].

MicroRNA-33 (miR-33), a novel non-coding RNA that coexpresses with sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), affects macrophage actions to prevent atherosclerosis. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an important regulator of lipid metabolism, especially for macrophage-related cholesterol export, but the mechanism is not fully studied. Interestingly, FGF21 has been evidenced to prevent atherosclerosis via inhibiting SREBP-2 expression. Therefore, we speculate that FGF21 may be a potential regulator for miR-33 with an aim of insight into novel anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms and research fields. Introduction Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by the deposition of excess lipids in the arterial intima. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) could counteract the pathogenic events by promoting cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) from the artery wall, which involves in a series of factors including macrophage or non-macrophage related cholesterol efflux, cell membrane bound transporters, plasma lipid acceptors, plasma proteins and enzymes, and hepatic cellular receptors. Macrophages exert important roles in cholesterol efflux and preventing atherosclerosis. Cholesterol efflux from atherosclerotic plaque is a featured function of macrophage, which is determined by two critical transporters on the membrane. One is ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), mainly interacting with cholesterol-deficient and phospholipiddepleted apolipoproteinA-I (apoA-I) complexes. The other is ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) that mediates macrophage cholesterol efflux through interacting with spherical, cholesterol-containing alpha HDL particles. Hence, increasing the two transporters on macrophages is critical to promoting RCT process and reversing atheroma.", "title": ""}, {"id": "7468003", "source": "pes2o_v2", "retrieval text": "Increased plasma FGF21 level as an early biomarker for insulin resistance and metabolic disturbance in obese insulin-resistant rats Propose: To investigate the temporal relationship between plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels, insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction and cardiac fibroblast growth factor 21 resistance in long-term high-fat diet\u2013induced obese rats.

Besides its antiobese and antidiabetic activity, FGF21 also possesses the protective effects against atherosclerosis. Circulating levels of FGF21 are elevated in patients with atherosclerosis, macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, possibly due to a compensatory upregulation. In apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, formation of atherosclerotic plaques is exacerbated by genetic depletion of FGF21, but is attenuated upon replenishment with recombinant FGF21. However, the blood vessel is not the direct target of FGF21, and the antiatherosclerotic activity of FGF21 is attributed to its actions in adipose tissues and liver. In adipocytes, FGF21 promotes secretion of adiponectin, which in turn acts directly on blood vessels to reduce endothelial dysfunction, inhibit proliferation of smooth muscle cells and block conversion of macrophages to foam cells.

These hormone-like FGFs are involved in the regulation of diverse metabolic pathways. FGF15/19 controls cholesterol/bile acid synthesis. FGF23 modulates phosphate/vitamin D metabolism, whereas FGF21 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism [2]. Physiologically, FGF21 expression is markedly increased in response to fasting/starvation, and elevated FGF21 is a central mediator for fasting-induced fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis and for inducing growth hormone resistance [3,4]. Pharmacologically, therapeutic intervention with recombinant FGF21 counteracts obesity and its related metabolic disorders in both rodents and nonhuman primates, including reduction of adiposity and amelioration of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease [5]. Furthermore, FGF21 is the downstream target of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3, and a growing body of evidence suggests that the glucose-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of the PPAR\u03b3 agonists (thiazolidinediones [TZDs]) and the therapeutic benefits of the PPAR\u03b1 agonists (fenofibrates) on lipid profiles are mediated in part by induction of FGF21 [6,7]. In addition to its multiple metabolic actions, emerging evidence suggests that FGF21 also possesses vascular protective activities, independent of its effects on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity. This review aims to summarize recent clinical and animal studies in this field, and discuss the molecular pathways underlying the antiatherosclerotic activities of FGF21.

The oligomerization pattern of adiponectin is altered in COPD; in particular the higher levels of adiponectin are associated with a specific increase of HMW [41,114]. Protective anti-inflammatory role of HMW oligomers has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro studies. We have shown that in A549 cells exposed to TNF and/or IL1 , adiponectin reduces in dose-and time-dependent manner cytotoxic effects of TNF and IL1 improving cell viability and decreasing apoptosis [60].

MicroRNA-33 (miR-33), a novel non-coding RNA that coexpresses with sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), affects macrophage actions to prevent atherosclerosis. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an important regulator of lipid metabolism, especially for macrophage-related cholesterol export, but the mechanism is not fully studied. Interestingly, FGF21 has been evidenced to prevent atherosclerosis via inhibiting SREBP-2 expression. Therefore, we speculate that FGF21 may be a potential regulator for miR-33 with an aim of insight into novel anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms and research fields. Introduction Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by the deposition of excess lipids in the arterial intima. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) could counteract the pathogenic events by promoting cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) from the artery wall, which involves in a series of factors including macrophage or non-macrophage related cholesterol efflux, cell membrane bound transporters, plasma lipid acceptors, plasma proteins and enzymes, and hepatic cellular receptors. Macrophages exert important roles in cholesterol efflux and preventing atherosclerosis. Cholesterol efflux from atherosclerotic plaque is a featured function of macrophage, which is determined by two critical transporters on the membrane. One is ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), mainly interacting with cholesterol-deficient and phospholipiddepleted apolipoproteinA-I (apoA-I) complexes. The other is ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) that mediates macrophage cholesterol efflux through interacting with spherical, cholesterol-containing alpha HDL particles. Hence, increasing the two transporters on macrophages is critical to promoting RCT process and reversing atheroma.\n[1] Increased plasma FGF21 level as an early biomarker for insulin resistance and metabolic disturbance in obese insulin-resistant rats Propose: To investigate the temporal relationship between plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels, insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction and cardiac fibroblast growth factor 21 resistance in long-term high-fat diet\u2013induced obese rats. Methods: In total, 36 male Wistar rats were fed with either a normal diet or high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Blood was collected from the tail tip, and plasma was used to determine metabolic profiles and fibroblast growth factor 21 levels. Rats were sacrificed at weeks 4, 8 and 12, and the hearts were rapidly removed for the determination of cardiac fibroblast growth factor 21 signalling pathways. Results: Body weight and plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels were increased after 4 weeks of consumption of a high-fat diet. At weeks 8 and 12, high-fat diet rats had significantly increased body weight and plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels, together with increased plasma insulin, HOMA index, area under the curve of glucose, plasma total cholesterol, plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum malondialdehyde and cardiac malondialdehyde levels. However, plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and cardiac fibroblast growth factor 21 signalling proteins (p-FGFR1 Tyr154, p-ERK1/2 Thr202/Tyr204 and p-Akt Ser473) were decreased, compared with normal diet rats. Conclusion: These findings suggest that plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels could be an early predictive biomarker prior to the development of insulin resistance, metabolic disturbance and cardiac fibroblast growth factor 21 resistance.\n[2] Ethyl acetate extract of sappanwood alleviates experimental atherosclerosis in rats through changes in FGF21 and SREBP-2 expression. Sappanwood extract shows promising effects against atherosclerosis. The fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) are involved in atherosclerosis development. This study aimed to examine whether sappanwood ethyl acetate extract (SEAE) alleviates experimental atherosclerosis in rats through FGF21/SREBP-2 signaling. Rats were randomized to six groups (n=10/group): blank control, model, simvastatin (positive control, 4.2 mg/kg/d), and SEAE high-, medium-, and low-dose (2.30, 1.15, and 0.575 g/kg/d, respectively). The high-fat- and vitamin D3-induced rodent model of atherosclerosis was created (except in the blank control group). Aorta and liver underwent histopathologic examination. SREPB-2 and FGF21 expression levels were examined by real-time RT-PCR and western blot. Compared with the blank control group, the model group showed aortic and hepatic histopathology compatible with the development of atherosclerosis due to a high-fat diet. In addition, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were elevated (all P<0.05). SREBP2 expression was high, and FGF21 expression was low (both P<0.05). Compared with the model group, SEAE alleviated the changes in liver and aorta by histopathology and decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-C (all P<0.05), especially in the medium-, and high-dose groups. In addition, medium-dose SEAE increased FGF21 levels (mRNA: +296%; protein: +69%; P<0.05) and decreased SREBP2 levels (mRNA: -44%; protein: -77%; P<0.05). Simvastatin, as the positive control, had similar effects to those of SEAE. In conclusion, SEAE improves lipid metabolism and alleviates atherosclerosis through changes in FGF21 and SREBP-2 expression levels.\n[3] Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Protects against Atherosclerosis via Fine-Tuning the Multiorgan Crosstalk Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects on energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Besides its antiobese and antidiabetic activity, FGF21 also possesses the protective effects against atherosclerosis. Circulating levels of FGF21 are elevated in patients with atherosclerosis, macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, possibly due to a compensatory upregulation. In apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, formation of atherosclerotic plaques is exacerbated by genetic depletion of FGF21, but is attenuated upon replenishment with recombinant FGF21. However, the blood vessel is not the direct target of FGF21, and the antiatherosclerotic activity of FGF21 is attributed to its actions in adipose tissues and liver. In adipocytes, FGF21 promotes secretion of adiponectin, which in turn acts directly on blood vessels to reduce endothelial dysfunction, inhibit proliferation of smooth muscle cells and block conversion of macrophages to foam cells. Furthermore, FGF21 suppresses cholesterol biosynthesis and attenuates hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 in hepatocytes. The effects of FGF21 on elevation of adiponectin and reduction of hypercholesterolemia are also observed in a phase-1b clinical trial in patients with obesity and diabetes. Therefore, FGF21 exerts its protection against atherosclerosis by fine-tuning the interorgan crosstalk between liver, brain, adipose tissue, and blood vessels. INTRODUCTION Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), along with FGF19 and FGF23, are endocrine factors that structurally belong to the FGF superfamily. Unlike the classic FGFs that require heparin for stable binding to the FGF receptors (FGFRs), the three endocrine members of\n[4] (fibroblast growth factor 21), 74 selenoprotein P, 75 adropin, and ANG-PTL (angiopoietin-like protein), 76 are closely related to CVD risk or CVD events. Hepatic steatosis induces Fetuin A also increases smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen deposition to accelerate vascular remodeling. 77 LECT2 is also a hepatocyte secreted protein positively correlated with the severity of liver steatosis. LECT2 induces atherosclerotic inflammatory reactions via CD209 receptor-mediated JNK (c-Jun NH 2-terminal kinase) activation in human endothelial cells. 73 On the contrary, certain hepatokines are upregulated in NAFLD and may have protective effects on the cardiovascular system. FGF21 confers an antiatherosclerosis benefit by inducing adipocyte production of adiponectin, which is an adipokine with anti-inflammatory and antiatherosclerotic properties, and by suppressing SREBP2-associated cholesterol biosynthesis. 78 Despite mounting evidence linking individual hepatokines and CVDs, it is challenging to determine the total effect of hepatokines considering the myriad of cross-organ interactions in the whole body. Given that the liver is one of the largest organs that produce and secrete proteins, using unbiased secretome analysis and system-based approaches may provide better insights to identify a set of hepatokines that correlate with the status of liver steatosis and future development of CVDs. In addition to an increased risk of atherosclerosis, myocardial remodeling and diastolic dysfunction have also been associated with NAFLD and its severity. 72,79 Fatty acids are the primary energy substrate for myocardial function through mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation. Excessive fatty acid supply under metabolic dysfunction leads to increased fatty acid uptake by CD36 and enhanced \u03b2-oxidation. 80 Meanwhile, IR in cardiomyocytes induces a marked\n[5] role in regulation of fibrosis, modulating fibroblasts activation and myofibroblasts differentiation. Adiponectin is a specific index of PPAR-gamma activity and displays also anti-inflammatory functions and its levels are reduced in several systemic rheumatic diseases. The biologic effects of adiponectin are mediated by two trans-membrane recep-tors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 linked to adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinases. Recent data from murine models of scleroderma, deepening the myofibroblasts differentiation and the role of PPAR-gamma, uncover the implication of adiponectin in the process of fibrosis. According to this evidence, adiponectin is involved in inhibition of skin fibrosis in scleroderma and represent an interesting therapeutic target,21. According to these findings, adiponectin could be a potential therapeutic approach to control dWAT attrition and myofibroblast development. In our study, a positive correlation exists between disease duration and basal adiponectin levels. That is rather discrepant, since basal adiponectin level is reduced with increasing fibrosis. The early SSc disease is characterized by the maximum progression rate of skin thickness, in a temporal window not clearly defined but considered around the first 18 months from thickness onset. The possible explanation is that skin fibrosis can be independent from disease duration after early SSc disease characterized by the maximum progression rate of skin thickness. To avoid the confounding impact of different disease phases on data analysis, requiring stratification of patients according to disease duration strata, we decided to enrol patients with disease duration > 2 years. The median disease duration of SSc sample enrolled in this study was about 12 years. In a recent study\n[6] Effect of Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 on the Development of Atheromatous Plaque and Lipid Metabolic Profiles in an Atherosclerosis-Prone Mouse Model Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormonal regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism. We aimed to investigate the effect of an FGF21 analogue (LY2405319) on the development of atherosclerosis and its associated parameters. ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 14 weeks and were randomly assigned to control (saline) or FGF21 (0.1 mg/kg) treatment group (n = 10/group) for 5 weeks. Plaque size in the aortic arch/valve areas and cardiovascular risk markers were evaluated in blood and tissues. The effects of FGF21 on various atherogenesis-related pathways were also assessed. Atherosclerotic plaque areas in the aortic arch/valve were significantly smaller in the FGF21 group than in controls after treatment. FGF21 significantly decreased body weight and glucose concentrations, and increased circulating adiponectin levels. FGF21 treatment alleviated insulin resistance and decreased circulating concentrations of triglycerides, which were significantly correlated with plaque size. FGF21 treatment reduced lipid droplets in the liver and decreased fat cell size and inflammatory cell infiltration in the abdominal visceral fat compared with the control group. The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels were decreased and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate levels were increased by FGF21 treatment. Uncoupling protein 1 expression in subcutaneous fat was greater and fat cell size in brown fat was smaller in the FGF21 group compared with controls. Administration of FGF21 showed anti-atherosclerotic effects in atherosclerosis-prone mice and exerted beneficial effects on critical atherosclerosis pathways. Improvements in inflammation and insulin resistance seem to be mechanisms\n[7] cardioprotective functions were prevented 94 .In patients with renal dysfunction, there is decreased clearance of adiponectin.Its levels are elevated and correlate with total cholesterol.The increased adiponectin levels could have a positive effect in reducing endothelial dysfunction triggered by dyslipidemia and other risk factors 95 .

However, Sattar et al. reported no significant relationship between serum adiponectin levels and risk of coronary heart disease and another study showed high adiponectin levels as predictor of adverse outcome in patients with acute coronary syndrome. These contradictory results might arise from confounding factors and different oligomers of adiponectin tested. Mice lacking adiponectin have severe neointimal injured arteries, and adiponectin restores neointimal proliferation; moreover, in cultured smooth muscle cells, adiponectin attenuated DNA synthesis induced by growth factors, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-(EGF-) like growth factor (HB-EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, and EGF and cell proliferation and migration induced by HB-EGF. In cultured endothelial cells, adiponectin attenuated HB-EGF expression stimulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha. In vitro studies have proved that adiponectin strongly inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in endothelial cells; in addition adiponectin reduces the transformation of macrophage to foam cells, inhibits TNF production, and stimulates the production of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide; systemic inflammation and extrapulmonary comorbidities contribute to the overall disease severity. Obesity in COPD is associated with increased symptoms of dyspnoea, poorer health-related quality of life, increased levels of fatigue, and exercise performance limitations,111. Low BMI is an independent risk factor for mortality in subjects with COPD, and this association is strongest in subjects with severe disease. In humans,\n[9] myocardial infarction. Additionally, there is a strong correlation between hypoadiponectinemia and coronary heart diseases well supported by clinical trials which confirm that higher incidences of cardiovascular events are associated with lower levels of adiponectin. Reports suggest HMW adiponectin to be a better independent risk factor than the total adiponectin for cardiovascular diseases,100. In vivo studies using adiponectin deficient mice reveal severely injured arteries while adiponectin supplementation impaired neointimal proliferation. In vitro culture studies demonstrate that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis, cell proliferation and cell migration are impaired by adiponectin. Adiponectin reduces inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in endothelial cells. Apart from inhibiting the conversion of macrophages into foam cells, adiponectin also decreases TNF-alpha production as well as induces the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a condition characterized by recurrent respiratory disorders during sleep. The level of adiponectin is undoubtedly lower in OSAS patients. A study by Hargens et al. confirmed lower adiponectin levels in OSAS patients in comparison to controls. Yet, there are some studies which suggest that patients suffering from OSAS do not show alteration in adiponectin levels. Intermittent hypoxia resulting in a decrease of total and HMW adiponectin is argued to be the major cause of the reduction of adiponectin in OSAS,106.

Macrophages exert important roles in cholesterol efflux and preventing atherosclerosis. Cholesterol efflux from atherosclerotic plaque is a featured function of macrophage, which is determined by two critical transporters on the membrane.

Macrophage counts in symptomatic carotid plaques are significantly increased and considered to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [2]. Moreover, macrophage phenotypes have been identified as important factors in atherosclerotic conditions [3]. Accordingly, macrophages in atherosclerotic plaque are divided as proand anti-inflammatory macrophages, with polarization phenotypes M1 and M2 macrophages respectively. Both the two kinds of macrophages are hallmarks of atherosclerotic lesions. M1 macrophages are the predominant phenotype in rupture-prone shoulder regions while M2 macrophages present more stable of atherosclerotic plaque and prevent foam cell formation [3,4]. It has been found that macrophages could alter their phenotypes and functions in response to certain stimulators or cytokines [5]. Thus, regulators to increase anti-inflammatory macrophages and decrease pro-inflammatory macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions are promising approaches to prevent atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and control a wide range of biological functions by base pair with specific mRNAs.

Besides its antiobese and antidiabetic activity, FGF21 also possesses the protective effects against atherosclerosis. Circulating levels of FGF21 are elevated in patients with atherosclerosis, macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, possibly due to a compensatory upregulation. In apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, formation of atherosclerotic plaques is exacerbated by genetic depletion of FGF21, but is attenuated upon replenishment with recombinant FGF21. However, the blood vessel is not the direct target of FGF21, and the antiatherosclerotic activity of FGF21 is attributed to its actions in adipose tissues and liver. In adipocytes, FGF21 promotes secretion of adiponectin, which in turn acts directly on blood vessels to reduce endothelial dysfunction, inhibit proliferation of smooth muscle cells and block conversion of macrophages to foam cells.

These hormone-like FGFs are involved in the regulation of diverse metabolic pathways. FGF15/19 controls cholesterol/bile acid synthesis. FGF23 modulates phosphate/vitamin D metabolism, whereas FGF21 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism [2]. Physiologically, FGF21 expression is markedly increased in response to fasting/starvation, and elevated FGF21 is a central mediator for fasting-induced fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis and for inducing growth hormone resistance [3,4]. Pharmacologically, therapeutic intervention with recombinant FGF21 counteracts obesity and its related metabolic disorders in both rodents and nonhuman primates, including reduction of adiposity and amelioration of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease [5]. Furthermore, FGF21 is the downstream target of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3, and a growing body of evidence suggests that the glucose-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of the PPAR\u03b3 agonists (thiazolidinediones [TZDs]) and the therapeutic benefits of the PPAR\u03b1 agonists (fenofibrates) on lipid profiles are mediated in part by induction of FGF21 [6,7].

The early SSc disease is characterized by the maximum progression rate of skin thickness, in a temporal window not clearly defined but considered around the first 18 months from thickness onset. The possible explanation is that skin fibrosis can be independent from disease duration after early SSc disease characterized by the maximum progression rate of skin thickness.

The biologic effects of adiponectin are mediated by two trans-membrane recep-tors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 linked to adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinases. Recent data from murine models of scleroderma, deepening the myofibroblasts differentiation and the role of PPAR-gamma, uncover the implication of adiponectin in the process of fibrosis. According to this evidence, adiponectin is involved in inhibition of skin fibrosis in scleroderma and represent an interesting therapeutic target,21. According to these findings, adiponectin could be a potential therapeutic approach to control dWAT attrition and myofibroblast development. In our study, a positive correlation exists between disease duration and basal adiponectin levels. That is rather discrepant, since basal adiponectin level is reduced with increasing fibrosis. The early SSc disease is characterized by the maximum progression rate of skin thickness, in a temporal window not clearly defined but considered around the first 18 months from thickness onset. The possible explanation is that skin fibrosis can be independent from disease duration after early SSc disease characterized by the maximum progression rate of skin thickness. To avoid the confounding impact of different disease phases on data analysis, requiring stratification of patients according to disease duration strata, we decided to enrol patients with disease duration > 2 years.

Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a noncommunicable disorder that threatens human health because of its various complications. As of 2019, an estimated 463 million people worldwide suffered from DM. The number of individuals with DM is expected to continue to grow, reaching about 700 million by 2045 (International Diabetes Federation, Diabetes Atlas 9th edition). If not properly treated, DM is accompanied by multiple complications in the eyes, kidneys, nerves, coronary arteries, and cerebrovascular and peripheral blood vessels, resulting in significant illness and incurring huge costs medically and socioeconomically [1]. There are many antidiabetic medications available at present and some have proven beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system as well as giving glycemic control. However, they have several side effects, such as genital infection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and gastrointestinal discomfort with glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues. New compounds have been developed to overcome the side effects of existing drugs. Among several candidates used for this purpose, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has drawn much attention. This is a hormone produced mainly by the liver [2]. Physiologically, the production and secretion of FGF21 increase in response to stress in the body, acting as an adaptive response [3]. Administration of FGF21 for pharmacological purposes shows favorable multifaceted effects on metabolically important organs [4].

The oligomerization pattern of adiponectin is altered in COPD; in particular the higher levels of adiponectin are associated with a specific increase of HMW [41,114]. Protective anti-inflammatory role of HMW oligomers has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro studies. We have shown that in A549 cells exposed to TNF and/or IL1 , adiponectin reduces in dose-and time-dependent manner cytotoxic effects of TNF and IL1 improving cell viability and decreasing apoptosis [60]. In addition, adiponectin inhibits NF-B nuclear transactivation and induces the expression of the anti-inflammatory IL10 cytokine via ERK1/2 and AKT through the specific mediation of AdipoR1.

Macrophages exert important roles in cholesterol efflux and preventing atherosclerosis. Cholesterol efflux from atherosclerotic plaque is a featured function of macrophage, which is determined by two critical transporters on the membrane.

Macrophage counts in symptomatic carotid plaques are significantly increased and considered to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [2]. Moreover, macrophage phenotypes have been identified as important factors in atherosclerotic conditions [3]. Accordingly, macrophages in atherosclerotic plaque are divided as proand anti-inflammatory macrophages, with polarization phenotypes M1 and M2 macrophages respectively. Both the two kinds of macrophages are hallmarks of atherosclerotic lesions. M1 macrophages are the predominant phenotype in rupture-prone shoulder regions while M2 macrophages present more stable of atherosclerotic plaque and prevent foam cell formation [3,4]. It has been found that macrophages could alter their phenotypes and functions in response to certain stimulators or cytokines [5]. Thus, regulators to increase anti-inflammatory macrophages and decrease pro-inflammatory macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions are promising approaches to prevent atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and control a wide range of biological functions by base pair with specific mRNAs. Recent reports have identified specific miRNAs as major regulators of lipid homeostasis and anti-atherosclerosis; and the best-characteristic one is miRNA-33 (miR-33) [6]. Although several recent findings reported that suppression of miR-33 is controversial in lipid metabolism and anti-atherosclerosis [7][8][9], more studies evidenced that inhibiting miR-33 could improve lipid profile and have atheroprotective properties.

Design Experimental. Setting Two Brazilian hospitals in 2013\u20132014. Population 30 fetal membranes collected after elective cesarean deliveries, in patients who underwent open fetal surgery for MMC intrauterine repair. Methods Regions within and surrounding the scar area and regions distant from the surgical site were evaluated for collagen concentration and expression of MMP-1, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Results Collagen was increased in regions of scar formation (14.4 \u00b1 2.7%) as compared to unaffected regions (8.0 \u00b1 1.9%) (p < .001). The mean score of MMP-9 in the area of both the scar and suture was also increased above that observed in normal regions (p < .05). Conversely, MMP-1 was reduced in the scar when compared to the normal region and the area adjacent to the scar (suture region) (p < .05). TIMP-1 was increased in the suture region compared to the normal region (p < .05) while TIMP-2 was reduced in the scar region when compared to the other two regions (p < .05). The membrane repair process was also influenced by the number of previous pregnancies and gestational age at the time of surgery.

Sappanwood extract shows promising effects against atherosclerosis. The fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) are involved in atherosclerosis development. This study aimed to examine whether sappanwood ethyl acetate extract (SEAE) alleviates experimental atherosclerosis in rats through FGF21/SREBP-2 signaling. Rats were randomized to six groups (n=10/group): blank control, model, simvastatin (positive control, 4.2 mg/kg/d), and SEAE high-, medium-, and low-dose (2.30, 1.15, and 0.575 g/kg/d, respectively). The high-fat- and vitamin D3-induced rodent model of atherosclerosis was created (except in the blank control group). Aorta and liver underwent histopathologic examination. SREPB-2 and FGF21 expression levels were examined by real-time RT-PCR and western blot. Compared with the blank control group, the model group showed aortic and hepatic histopathology compatible with the development of atherosclerosis due to a high-fat diet. In addition, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were elevated (all P<0.05). SREBP2 expression was high, and FGF21 expression was low (both P<0.05). Compared with the model group, SEAE alleviated the changes in liver and aorta by histopathology and decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-C (all P<0.05), especially in the medium-, and high-dose groups. In addition, medium-dose SEAE increased FGF21 levels (mRNA: +296%; protein: +69%; P<0.05) and decreased SREBP2 levels (mRNA: -44%; protein: -77%; P<0.05).

Besides its antiobese and antidiabetic activity, FGF21 also possesses the protective effects against atherosclerosis. Circulating levels of FGF21 are elevated in patients with atherosclerosis, macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, possibly due to a compensatory upregulation.

However, the blood vessel is not the direct target of FGF21, and the antiatherosclerotic activity of FGF21 is attributed to its actions in adipose tissues and liver. In adipocytes, FGF21 promotes secretion of adiponectin, which in turn acts directly on blood vessels to reduce endothelial dysfunction, inhibit proliferation of smooth muscle cells and block conversion of macrophages to foam cells.

These hormone-like FGFs are involved in the regulation of diverse metabolic pathways. FGF15/19 controls cholesterol/bile acid synthesis. FGF23 modulates phosphate/vitamin D metabolism, whereas FGF21 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism [2]. Physiologically, FGF21 expression is markedly increased in response to fasting/starvation, and elevated FGF21 is a central mediator for fasting-induced fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis and for inducing growth hormone resistance [3,4]. Pharmacologically, therapeutic intervention with recombinant FGF21 counteracts obesity and its related metabolic disorders in both rodents and nonhuman primates, including reduction of adiposity and amelioration of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease [5]. Furthermore, FGF21 is the downstream target of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3, and a growing body of evidence suggests that the glucose-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of the PPAR\u03b3 agonists (thiazolidinediones [TZDs]) and the therapeutic benefits of the PPAR\u03b1 agonists (fenofibrates) on lipid profiles are mediated in part by induction of FGF21 [6,7]. In addition to its multiple metabolic actions, emerging evidence suggests that FGF21 also possesses vascular protective activities, independent of its effects on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity. This review aims to summarize recent clinical and animal studies in this field, and discuss the molecular pathways underlying the antiatherosclerotic activities of FGF21. BASIC BIOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF FGF21 FGF21 was initially identified as a metabolic regulator by a high throughput glucose uptake screen in 3T3-L1 adipocytes [8].

Emerging single-cell RNA-sequencing technology is capable of providing high-resolution insights into immune cell subsets and their transcriptional signature alterations determining NAFLD progression.

Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a noncommunicable disorder that threatens human health because of its various complications. As of 2019, an estimated 463 million people worldwide suffered from DM. The number of individuals with DM is expected to continue to grow, reaching about 700 million by 2045 (International Diabetes Federation, Diabetes Atlas 9th edition). If not properly treated, DM is accompanied by multiple complications in the eyes, kidneys, nerves, coronary arteries, and cerebrovascular and peripheral blood vessels, resulting in significant illness and incurring huge costs medically and socioeconomically [1]. There are many antidiabetic medications available at present and some have proven beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system as well as giving glycemic control. However, they have several side effects, such as genital infection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and gastrointestinal discomfort with glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues.

Additionally, there is a strong correlation between hypoadiponectinemia and coronary heart diseases well supported by clinical trials which confirm that higher incidences of cardiovascular events are associated with lower levels of adiponectin [98]. Reports suggest HMW adiponectin to be a better independent risk factor than the total adiponectin for cardiovascular diseases [99,100]. In vivo studies using adiponectin deficient mice reveal severely injured arteries while adiponectin supplementation impaired neointimal proliferation. In vitro culture studies demonstrate that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis, cell proliferation and cell migration are impaired by adiponectin [101]. Adiponectin reduces inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in endothelial cells. Apart from inhibiting the conversion of macrophages into foam cells, adiponectin also decreases TNF-alpha production as well as induces the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 [102].

The oligomerization pattern of adiponectin is altered in COPD; in particular the higher levels of adiponectin are associated with a specific increase of HMW [41,114]. Protective anti-inflammatory role of HMW oligomers has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro studies. We have shown that in A549 cells exposed to TNF and/or IL1 , adiponectin reduces in dose-and time-dependent manner cytotoxic effects of TNF and IL1 improving cell viability and decreasing apoptosis [60].

MicroRNA-33 (miR-33), a novel non-coding RNA that coexpresses with sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), affects macrophage actions to prevent atherosclerosis. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an important regulator of lipid metabolism, especially for macrophage-related cholesterol export, but the mechanism is not fully studied. Interestingly, FGF21 has been evidenced to prevent atherosclerosis via inhibiting SREBP-2 expression. Therefore, we speculate that FGF21 may be a potential regulator for miR-33 with an aim of insight into novel anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms and research fields. Introduction Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by the deposition of excess lipids in the arterial intima. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) could counteract the pathogenic events by promoting cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) from the artery wall, which involves in a series of factors including macrophage or non-macrophage related cholesterol efflux, cell membrane bound transporters, plasma lipid acceptors, plasma proteins and enzymes, and hepatic cellular receptors. Macrophages exert important roles in cholesterol efflux and preventing atherosclerosis. Cholesterol efflux from atherosclerotic plaque is a featured function of macrophage, which is determined by two critical transporters on the membrane. One is ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), mainly interacting with cholesterol-deficient and phospholipiddepleted apolipoproteinA-I (apoA-I) complexes. The other is ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) that mediates macrophage cholesterol efflux through interacting with spherical, cholesterol-containing alpha HDL particles. Hence, increasing the two transporters on macrophages is critical to promoting RCT process and reversing atheroma.\n[1] Increased plasma FGF21 level as an early biomarker for insulin resistance and metabolic disturbance in obese insulin-resistant rats Propose: To investigate the temporal relationship between plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels, insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction and cardiac fibroblast growth factor 21 resistance in long-term high-fat diet\u2013induced obese rats. Methods: In total, 36 male Wistar rats were fed with either a normal diet or high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Blood was collected from the tail tip, and plasma was used to determine metabolic profiles and fibroblast growth factor 21 levels. Rats were sacrificed at weeks 4, 8 and 12, and the hearts were rapidly removed for the determination of cardiac fibroblast growth factor 21 signalling pathways. Results: Body weight and plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels were increased after 4 weeks of consumption of a high-fat diet. At weeks 8 and 12, high-fat diet rats had significantly increased body weight and plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels, together with increased plasma insulin, HOMA index, area under the curve of glucose, plasma total cholesterol, plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum malondialdehyde and cardiac malondialdehyde levels. However, plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and cardiac fibroblast growth factor 21 signalling proteins (p-FGFR1 Tyr154, p-ERK1/2 Thr202/Tyr204 and p-Akt Ser473) were decreased, compared with normal diet rats. Conclusion: These findings suggest that plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels could be an early predictive biomarker prior to the development of insulin resistance, metabolic disturbance and cardiac fibroblast growth factor 21 resistance.\n[2] Ethyl acetate extract of sappanwood alleviates experimental atherosclerosis in rats through changes in FGF21 and SREBP-2 expression. Sappanwood extract shows promising effects against atherosclerosis. The fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) are involved in atherosclerosis development. This study aimed to examine whether sappanwood ethyl acetate extract (SEAE) alleviates experimental atherosclerosis in rats through FGF21/SREBP-2 signaling. Rats were randomized to six groups (n=10/group): blank control, model, simvastatin (positive control, 4.2 mg/kg/d), and SEAE high-, medium-, and low-dose (2.30, 1.15, and 0.575 g/kg/d, respectively). The high-fat- and vitamin D3-induced rodent model of atherosclerosis was created (except in the blank control group). Aorta and liver underwent histopathologic examination. SREPB-2 and FGF21 expression levels were examined by real-time RT-PCR and western blot. Compared with the blank control group, the model group showed aortic and hepatic histopathology compatible with the development of atherosclerosis due to a high-fat diet. In addition, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were elevated (all P<0.05). SREBP2 expression was high, and FGF21 expression was low (both P<0.05). Compared with the model group, SEAE alleviated the changes in liver and aorta by histopathology and decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-C (all P<0.05), especially in the medium-, and high-dose groups. In addition, medium-dose SEAE increased FGF21 levels (mRNA: +296%; protein: +69%; P<0.05) and decreased SREBP2 levels (mRNA: -44%; protein: -77%; P<0.05). Simvastatin, as the positive control, had similar effects to those of SEAE. In conclusion, SEAE improves lipid metabolism and alleviates atherosclerosis through changes in FGF21 and SREBP-2 expression levels.\n[3] Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Protects against Atherosclerosis via Fine-Tuning the Multiorgan Crosstalk Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects on energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Besides its antiobese and antidiabetic activity, FGF21 also possesses the protective effects against atherosclerosis. Circulating levels of FGF21 are elevated in patients with atherosclerosis, macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, possibly due to a compensatory upregulation. In apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, formation of atherosclerotic plaques is exacerbated by genetic depletion of FGF21, but is attenuated upon replenishment with recombinant FGF21. However, the blood vessel is not the direct target of FGF21, and the antiatherosclerotic activity of FGF21 is attributed to its actions in adipose tissues and liver. In adipocytes, FGF21 promotes secretion of adiponectin, which in turn acts directly on blood vessels to reduce endothelial dysfunction, inhibit proliferation of smooth muscle cells and block conversion of macrophages to foam cells. Furthermore, FGF21 suppresses cholesterol biosynthesis and attenuates hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 in hepatocytes. The effects of FGF21 on elevation of adiponectin and reduction of hypercholesterolemia are also observed in a phase-1b clinical trial in patients with obesity and diabetes. Therefore, FGF21 exerts its protection against atherosclerosis by fine-tuning the interorgan crosstalk between liver, brain, adipose tissue, and blood vessels. INTRODUCTION Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), along with FGF19 and FGF23, are endocrine factors that structurally belong to the FGF superfamily. Unlike the classic FGFs that require heparin for stable binding to the FGF receptors (FGFRs), the three endocrine members of\n[4] (fibroblast growth factor 21), 74 selenoprotein P, 75 adropin, and ANG-PTL (angiopoietin-like protein), 76 are closely related to CVD risk or CVD events. Hepatic steatosis induces Fetuin A also increases smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen deposition to accelerate vascular remodeling. 77 LECT2 is also a hepatocyte secreted protein positively correlated with the severity of liver steatosis. LECT2 induces atherosclerotic inflammatory reactions via CD209 receptor-mediated JNK (c-Jun NH 2-terminal kinase) activation in human endothelial cells. 73 On the contrary, certain hepatokines are upregulated in NAFLD and may have protective effects on the cardiovascular system. FGF21 confers an antiatherosclerosis benefit by inducing adipocyte production of adiponectin, which is an adipokine with anti-inflammatory and antiatherosclerotic properties, and by suppressing SREBP2-associated cholesterol biosynthesis. 78 Despite mounting evidence linking individual hepatokines and CVDs, it is challenging to determine the total effect of hepatokines considering the myriad of cross-organ interactions in the whole body. Given that the liver is one of the largest organs that produce and secrete proteins, using unbiased secretome analysis and system-based approaches may provide better insights to identify a set of hepatokines that correlate with the status of liver steatosis and future development of CVDs. In addition to an increased risk of atherosclerosis, myocardial remodeling and diastolic dysfunction have also been associated with NAFLD and its severity. 72,79 Fatty acids are the primary energy substrate for myocardial function through mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation. Excessive fatty acid supply under metabolic dysfunction leads to increased fatty acid uptake by CD36 and enhanced \u03b2-oxidation. 80 Meanwhile, IR in cardiomyocytes induces a marked\n[5] role in regulation of fibrosis, modulating fibroblasts activation and myofibroblasts differentiation. Adiponectin is a specific index of PPAR-gamma activity and displays also anti-inflammatory functions and its levels are reduced in several systemic rheumatic diseases. The biologic effects of adiponectin are mediated by two trans-membrane recep-tors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 linked to adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinases. Recent data from murine models of scleroderma, deepening the myofibroblasts differentiation and the role of PPAR-gamma, uncover the implication of adiponectin in the process of fibrosis. According to this evidence, adiponectin is involved in inhibition of skin fibrosis in scleroderma and represent an interesting therapeutic target,21. According to these findings, adiponectin could be a potential therapeutic approach to control dWAT attrition and myofibroblast development. In our study, a positive correlation exists between disease duration and basal adiponectin levels. That is rather discrepant, since basal adiponectin level is reduced with increasing fibrosis. The early SSc disease is characterized by the maximum progression rate of skin thickness, in a temporal window not clearly defined but considered around the first 18 months from thickness onset. The possible explanation is that skin fibrosis can be independent from disease duration after early SSc disease characterized by the maximum progression rate of skin thickness. To avoid the confounding impact of different disease phases on data analysis, requiring stratification of patients according to disease duration strata, we decided to enrol patients with disease duration > 2 years. The median disease duration of SSc sample enrolled in this study was about 12 years. In a recent study\n[6] Effect of Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 on the Development of Atheromatous Plaque and Lipid Metabolic Profiles in an Atherosclerosis-Prone Mouse Model Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormonal regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism. We aimed to investigate the effect of an FGF21 analogue (LY2405319) on the development of atherosclerosis and its associated parameters. ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 14 weeks and were randomly assigned to control (saline) or FGF21 (0.1 mg/kg) treatment group (n = 10/group) for 5 weeks. Plaque size in the aortic arch/valve areas and cardiovascular risk markers were evaluated in blood and tissues. The effects of FGF21 on various atherogenesis-related pathways were also assessed. Atherosclerotic plaque areas in the aortic arch/valve were significantly smaller in the FGF21 group than in controls after treatment. FGF21 significantly decreased body weight and glucose concentrations, and increased circulating adiponectin levels. FGF21 treatment alleviated insulin resistance and decreased circulating concentrations of triglycerides, which were significantly correlated with plaque size. FGF21 treatment reduced lipid droplets in the liver and decreased fat cell size and inflammatory cell infiltration in the abdominal visceral fat compared with the control group. The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels were decreased and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate levels were increased by FGF21 treatment. Uncoupling protein 1 expression in subcutaneous fat was greater and fat cell size in brown fat was smaller in the FGF21 group compared with controls. Administration of FGF21 showed anti-atherosclerotic effects in atherosclerosis-prone mice and exerted beneficial effects on critical atherosclerosis pathways. Improvements in inflammation and insulin resistance seem to be mechanisms\n[7] cardioprotective functions were prevented 94 .In patients with renal dysfunction, there is decreased clearance of adiponectin.Its levels are elevated and correlate with total cholesterol.The increased adiponectin levels could have a positive effect in reducing endothelial dysfunction triggered by dyslipidemia and other risk factors 95 . Other adipokines with potentially important cardiovascular effects Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is produced by adipose tissue, liver, and according to recent research also by cardiomyocytes.FGF21 improves insulin sensitivity, glucose reuptake, decreases lipogenesis and lipid oxidation 96 .High levels of FGF21 were associated with atherosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, coronary artery disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy 96 .Experimentally induced myocardial hypertrophy or infarction lead to increased expression of FGF21 (ref. 97), which might prevent further progression of myocardial damage. Chemerin regulates adipokine differentiation and has an important role in chemotaxis of dendritic cells and macrophages in inflammatiory tissues 98 .Levels of chemerin correlate positively with body mass index, blood pressure, serum LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and negatively with serum HDL-cholesterol 99 .Because of its chemotactic effects, mediated decrease in NO produc-tion 100 and negative effects on plasma lipids, chemerin is linked to progression of atherosclerosis.Some studies showed positive association between chemerin levels and stable chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), but some found increased chemerin level only in patients with acute coronary syndrome and not in stable CAD (ref. 101). C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein, produced in liver and adipose tissue.Small increases of CRP in high sensitivity analyses (hs-CRP) between 1-3 mg/L are, based on large epidemiology trials, traditionally linked with moderate risk\n[8] myocardial infarction. Additionally, there is a strong correlation between hypoadiponectinemia and coronary heart diseases well supported by clinical trials which confirm that higher incidences of cardiovascular events are associated with lower levels of adiponectin. Reports suggest HMW adiponectin to be a better independent risk factor than the total adiponectin for cardiovascular diseases,100. In vivo studies using adiponectin deficient mice reveal severely injured arteries while adiponectin supplementation impaired neointimal proliferation. In vitro culture studies demonstrate that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis, cell proliferation and cell migration are impaired by adiponectin. Adiponectin reduces inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in endothelial cells. Apart from inhibiting the conversion of macrophages into foam cells, adiponectin also decreases TNF-alpha production as well as induces the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10.

The level of adiponectin is undoubtedly lower in OSAS patients. A study by Hargens et al. confirmed lower adiponectin levels in OSAS patients in comparison to controls. Yet, there are some studies which suggest that patients suffering from OSAS do not show alteration in adiponectin levels. Intermittent hypoxia resulting in a decrease of total and HMW adiponectin is argued to be the major cause of the reduction of adiponectin in OSAS,106. Diabetic Retinopathy One of the major risk factors for diabetic microvascular complications is obesity. Increased levels of glucose\n[9] levels have been found to be inversely correlated to a marker of carotid atherosclerosis (intima thickness). However, Sattar et al. reported no significant relationship between serum adiponectin levels and risk of coronary heart disease and another study showed high adiponectin levels as predictor of adverse outcome in patients with acute coronary syndrome. These contradictory results might arise from confounding factors and different oligomers of adiponectin tested. Mice lacking adiponectin have severe neointimal injured arteries, and adiponectin restores neointimal proliferation; moreover, in cultured smooth muscle cells, adiponectin attenuated DNA synthesis induced by growth factors, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-(EGF-) like growth factor (HB-EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, and EGF and cell proliferation and migration induced by HB-EGF.

Since then, RNAi has proven to be a powerful experimental tool to gain insight into gene function in multiple organisms [1]. During RNAi in C. elegans, dsRNA serves as a trigger for sequence-specific degradation of mRNA as a mechanism of gene silencing [2,3]. The dsRNA is first cleaved into short-interfering (si) RNAs by a complex containing Dicer, an RNase III family endoribonuclease. These siRNAs are then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where they guide recognition of the target-complementary mRNA, which is subsequently cleaved and degraded. Intriguingly, only a few molecules of dsRNA are sufficient to direct degradation of a much larger population of mRNAs [4,5]. This is due to an amplification process mediated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs). The RdRPs use siRNAs derived from Dicer-complex processing as primers to produce more dsRNA, with the mature endogenous mRNA as a template. These newly synthesized dsRNA molecules may also feed back into the Dicer complex to be cleaved into additional siRNA (for review, see [4,5]). In C. elegans, four RdRP homologs have been identified to date: EGO-1 and RRF-1, -2, and -3. EGO-1 and RRF-1 have been implicated in the amplification of exogenous RNAi [6,7], whereas RRF-3 is required for the production and/or stabilization of a subset of endogenous siRNAs [7,8].

Introduction The reproductive system in many animals including vertebrates, insects and nematodes regulates lifespan [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] and the interactions between the reproductive system and lifespan have been extensively studied in Caenorhabditis elegans. When the C. elegans germline is removed by either genetic means or cell ablation, its lifespan can be extended by 60% [1]. The enhanced lifespan is not a simple life-history trade-off between reproduction and somatic tissue maintenance because C. elegans rendered sterile by complete gonad ablation or other manipulations live only as long as C. elegans with intact germline [1]. The role of gonadal tissue in regulating pro-longevity or pathogen resistance genes has not been studied at a whole-genome level. Therefore, to understand the contribution of gonadal tissue to lifespan and immunity regulating genes, and the role of the innate immune system towards lifespan extension in germlinedeficient C. elegans at a genome-wide scale, we combined laser cell ablation to kill the germline and gonad precursor cells, with whole genome microarrays, followed by an RNAi knockdown screen to identify mechanistic processes involved in both longevity and immunity.

Concluding Remarks The recent literature reviewed here underscores the value of basic epigenetics research in a nematode model. More importantly, recent discoveries pose tantalizing questions for future inquiries. The importance of small RNAs in transgenerational transgene silencing and in aberrant progressive silencing of endogenous genes, which underlies the Mrt phenotype, is well documented. However, the mechanistic links between small RNAs and histone modifying complexes participating in these phenomena are poorly understood and should be investigated in the future. There is still a debate on whether the inappropriate silencing of just one category of repetitive genes, such as the rDNA repeats or histone gene loci, is responsible for the Mrt phenotype of animals lacking piRNAs. It is likely that the silencing of both types of targets contributes to the Mrt sterility. Moreover, it was shown that the Mrt phenotype can be suppressed by insulin signaling pathway mutants [91]. It is not clear whether the insulin signaling pathway regulates small RNAs matching histone genes, rDNA repeats, or something else.

Summary Animals constantly encounter environmental and intrinsic challenges that affect genome/transcriptome integrity, and the ability to grow. For species survival, animals must maintain reproductive fidelity to ensure their genomic content is accurately inherited.

Since then, RNAi has proven to be a powerful experimental tool to gain insight into gene function in multiple organisms [1]. During RNAi in C. elegans, dsRNA serves as a trigger for sequence-specific degradation of mRNA as a mechanism of gene silencing [2,3]. The dsRNA is first cleaved into short-interfering (si) RNAs by a complex containing Dicer, an RNase III family endoribonuclease. These siRNAs are then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where they guide recognition of the target-complementary mRNA, which is subsequently cleaved and degraded. Intriguingly, only a few molecules of dsRNA are sufficient to direct degradation of a much larger population of mRNAs [4,5]. This is due to an amplification process mediated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs). The RdRPs use siRNAs derived from Dicer-complex processing as primers to produce more dsRNA, with the mature endogenous mRNA as a template. These newly synthesized dsRNA molecules may also feed back into the Dicer complex to be cleaved into additional siRNA (for review, see [4,5]). In C. elegans, four RdRP homologs have been identified to date: EGO-1 and RRF-1, -2, and -3. EGO-1 and RRF-1 have been implicated in the amplification of exogenous RNAi [6,7], whereas RRF-3 is required for the production and/or stabilization of a subset of endogenous siRNAs [7,8].

Introduction The reproductive system in many animals including vertebrates, insects and nematodes regulates lifespan [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] and the interactions between the reproductive system and lifespan have been extensively studied in Caenorhabditis elegans. When the C. elegans germline is removed by either genetic means or cell ablation, its lifespan can be extended by 60% [1]. The enhanced lifespan is not a simple life-history trade-off between reproduction and somatic tissue maintenance because C. elegans rendered sterile by complete gonad ablation or other manipulations live only as long as C. elegans with intact germline [1]. The role of gonadal tissue in regulating pro-longevity or pathogen resistance genes has not been studied at a whole-genome level. Therefore, to understand the contribution of gonadal tissue to lifespan and immunity regulating genes, and the role of the innate immune system towards lifespan extension in germlinedeficient C. elegans at a genome-wide scale, we combined laser cell ablation to kill the germline and gonad precursor cells, with whole genome microarrays, followed by an RNAi knockdown screen to identify mechanistic processes involved in both longevity and immunity. We also analyzed the evolutionary conservation of germline-regulated genes required for enhanced lifespan and immunity between C. elegans and the related model nematode P. pacificus [37].

Concluding Remarks The recent literature reviewed here underscores the value of basic epigenetics research in a nematode model. More importantly, recent discoveries pose tantalizing questions for future inquiries. The importance of small RNAs in transgenerational transgene silencing and in aberrant progressive silencing of endogenous genes, which underlies the Mrt phenotype, is well documented. However, the mechanistic links between small RNAs and histone modifying complexes participating in these phenomena are poorly understood and should be investigated in the future. There is still a debate on whether the inappropriate silencing of just one category of repetitive genes, such as the rDNA repeats or histone gene loci, is responsible for the Mrt phenotype of animals lacking piRNAs. It is likely that the silencing of both types of targets contributes to the Mrt sterility. Moreover, it was shown that the Mrt phenotype can be suppressed by insulin signaling pathway mutants [91]. It is not clear whether the insulin signaling pathway regulates small RNAs matching histone genes, rDNA repeats, or something else. It is curious that insulin signaling mutant backgrounds allow a more robust response to experimental RNAi [92] further underscoring the connection to small RNA regulation.

To investigate whether the piRNA pathway is required for germline nuclear RNAi activity on the native targets, we performed genome-wide analyses using a piRNA pathway mutant.

Retrotransposon silencing By taking a combined genetic, biochemical, and computational approach, we identified a distinct set of genomic regions that are naturally targeted by germline nuclear RNAi for transcriptional silencing and/or heterochromatin formation in C. elegans. The enrichment of retrotransposon elements in these regions suggests that germline nuclear RNAi evolved as a genome defense mechanism against this type of mobile DNA. Our detailed wholegenome profiling of Pol II occupancy and pre-mRNA indicates that, first, the HRDE-1-targeted retrotransposons in C. elegans are intrinsically active in transcription.

Our results support a model in which nuclear-localized small regulatory RNAs are important mediators of chromatin organization and compaction in C. elegans. Results endogenous siRNAs may compact germline chromatin. Small regulatory RNAs, such as siRNAs or piRNAs, have been linked to heterochromatin formation in many eukaryotes, suggesting that small RNAs may act as specificity factors, acting via Watson-Crick base pairing, for directing heterochromatin formation and chromatin compaction in many eukaryotes 27 . In C. elegans, the GHKL ATPase MORC-1, a component of the nuclear RNAi machinery, promotes chromatin organization and chromatin compaction in adult C. elegans germ cells, suggesting that siRNAs, acting via the nuclear RNAi machinery and MORC-1, also regulate chromatin compaction in C. elegans 40 . To further test this idea, we asked if two other components of the C. elegans nuclear RNAi machinery: the germline expressed nuclear RNAi AGO HRDE-1, and the nuclear RNAi factor NRDE-2, were, like MORC-1, needed for chromatin organization\n[1] after the initial dsRNA exposure. Most of the published studies rely on phenotype or protein expression to measure the silencing state. As such, a lack of transcriptional repression can be masked by an active classical RNAi (post-transcriptional silencing). In the case of the endogenous nuclear RNAi targets (guided by endo-siRNAs), the establishment phase likely occurs soon after the first invasion of an LTR retrotransposon or other types of repetitive DNA into the C. elegans genome. We and others previously found that the transcription of these endogenous targets are highly active in the hrde-1 and other nuclear RNAi mutants (Buckley et al., 2012;Ni et al., 2014Ni et al., , 2016, indicating that these targets still contain their transcriptional activating cis-regulatory elements. It remains an open question how soon a transposable element is silenced after its initial integration into the genome. Transgene has a strong tendency to be silenced in the C. elegans germline (Kelly et al., 1997). Interestingly, the silencing does not occur immediately after the transformation but gradually reaches the highest level over a course of multiple generations (Kelly et al., 1997), suggesting that the establishment of silencing at a transgene is a transgenerational process. The establishment process at the endogenous nuclear RNAi targets is highly important to our knowledge of genome surveillance. However, this process is largely elusive due to a lack of experimental system. Published work on the endogenous targets have been limited on the maintenance phase. In this study, we developed different strategies to examine the establishment process of silencing for an exogenous\n[2] C. elegans rrf-1 Mutations Maintain RNAi Efficiency in the Soma in Addition to the Germline Gene inactivation through RNA interference (RNAi) has proven to be a valuable tool for studying gene function in C. elegans. When combined with tissue-specific gene inactivation methods, RNAi has the potential to shed light on the function of a gene in distinct tissues. In this study we characterized C. elegans rrf-1 mutants to determine their ability to process RNAi in various tissues. These mutants have been widely used in RNAi studies to assess the function of genes specifically in the C. elegans germline. Upon closer analysis, we found that two rrf-1 mutants carrying different loss-of-function alleles were capable of processing RNAi targeting several somatically expressed genes. Specifically, we observed that the intestine was able to process RNAi triggers efficiently, whereas cells in the hypodermis showed partial susceptibility to RNAi in rrf-1 mutants. Other somatic tissues in rrf-1 mutants, such as the muscles and the somatic gonad, appeared resistant to RNAi. In addition to these observations, we found that the rrf-1(pk1417) mutation induced the expression of several transgenic arrays, including the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Unexpectedly, rrf-1(pk1417) mutants showed increased endogenous expression of the DAF-16 target gene sod-3; however, the lifespan and thermo-tolerance of rrf-1(pk1417) mutants were similar to those of wild-type animals. In sum, these data show that rrf-1 mutants display several phenotypes not previously appreciated, including broader tissue-specific RNAi-processing capabilities, and our results underscore the need for careful characterization of tissue-specific RNAi tools. Introduction Double-stranded (ds) RNA-induced gene silencing, also\n[3] somatic tissues are entirely post-mitotic.Consistent with this idea, genetic inhibition of cdk-2 and cye-1 did not further extend the lifespan of glp-1 mutants in which the number of germline stem cell is markedly reduced (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 2A).Similarly, inactivation of cye-1 did not increase longevity in mes-1 mutants that fail to develop a germline and are sterile, by contrast to results obtained in fertile mes-1 mutants (Figure 2B).Moreover, cye-1(RNAi) increased lifespan in rrf-1 mutants in which RNAi-mediated gene knockdown functions most efficiently in the germline (Supplementary Figure 2B).Importantly, the longevity effect was still apparent when RNAi-mediated cye-1 knockdown was initiated at different stages, during larval development or later adulthood (day 3) (Supplementary Figure 1A).Of note, lifespan can be extended in C. elegans when germline proliferation is inhibited by glp-1 inactivation during adulthood.In flies, similar findings have been described.Together, our data show that the benefits associated with genetic inhibition of cell cycle regulators involve germline mechanisms. It is well established that germline-mediated longevity requires the activity of the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 and a lipophilic hormone/steroid signaling pathway comprising DAF-9 and DAF-12,7,13,37.We found that these canonical germline pathway components also play a critical role in the increases in lifespan that derive from cell cycle inhibition (Figure 2C and D, Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 2C and D).Interestingly, the dramatic lifespan extension associated with knockdown of cye-1 and cdk-2 was not fully eliminated in two daf-16 null mutants indicating that DAF-16 is central for the influence of cell cycle regulators on longevity, but\n[4] A Functional Genomic Screen for Evolutionarily Conserved Genes Required for Lifespan and Immunity in Germline-Deficient C. elegans The reproductive system regulates lifespan in insects, nematodes and vertebrates. In Caenorhabditis elegans removal of germline increases lifespan by 60% which is dependent upon insulin signaling, nuclear hormone signaling, autophagy and fat metabolism and their microRNA-regulators. Germline-deficient C. elegans are also more resistant to various bacterial pathogens but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Firstly, we demonstrate that previously identified genes that regulate the extended lifespan of germline-deficient C. elegans (daf-2, daf-16, daf-12, tcer-1, mir-7.1 and nhr-80) are also essential for resistance to the pathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila. We then use a novel unbiased approach combining laser cell ablation, whole genome microarrays, RNAi screening and exposure to X. nematophila to generate a comprehensive genome-wide catalog of genes potentially required for increased lifespan and innate immunity in germline-deficient C. elegans. We find 3,440 genes to be upregulated in C. elegans germline-deficient animals in a gonad dependent manner, which are significantly enriched for genes involved in insulin signaling, fatty acid desaturation, translation elongation and proteasome complex function. Using RNAi against a subset of 150 candidate genes selected from the microarray results, we show that the upregulated genes such as transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO, the PTEN homolog lipid phosphatase DAF-18 and several components of the proteasome complex (rpn-6.1, rpn-7, rpn-9, rpn-10, rpt-6, pbs-3 and pbs-6) are essential for both lifespan and immunity of germline deficient animals. We also identify a novel role for genes including par-5 and T12G3.6 in both lifespan-extension and\n[5] tail of CENP-A,81. Surprisingly, the N-terminal tail is dispensable for mitotic divisions during late embryogenesis, larval development, and germline proliferation. Thus, there are distinct steps of initiation and maintenance governing the epigenetic inheritance of CENP-A between generations in C. elegans. What could serve as a signal for the de novo CENP-A placement in the zygote? Earlier studies from Desai, Strome, and colleagues suggested that the memory of germline transcription is key. Importantly, there are worm antisense siRNAs produced by RdRPs on germline-expressed mRNA templates that are distinct from the silencing siRNAs. They are bound to the Argonaute CSR-1, which is present both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus,85. The nuclear CSR-1 complex is thought to mark genomic regions repelling the silencing chromatin marks,86,87, which correlate with CENP-A placement,86. The mechanism of this is not clear. If this scenario is correct, then CENP-A incorporation should proceed by default. There is also the possibility of both repelling and attracting marks guiding the de novo CENP-A pattern establishment. Environment In C. elegans, \"silencing\" chromatin marks are enriched on autosome arms whereas the essential genes, including most germline genes, are located at the centers of autosomes (Figure 4b). Therefore, it is thought that the chromosome location (i.e., active or closed chromatin environment) determines whether the gene is expressed in the germline or not. Surprisingly, this is not the whole story. Fr\u00f8kjaer-Jensen and co-authors discovered periodic DNA sequence patterns, namely 10-base pair periodic An/Tn-clusters (PATCs), which are correlated with germline expression of\n[6] germline nuclear RNAi on the expression of a neighboring gene. We found that loss of eri-6/7 had no silencing defects on the natural targets of germline nuclear RNAi [data not shown. The piRNA pathway is not required for germline nuclear RNAi responses at the native targets The piRNA pathway in C. elegans plays an important role in silencing certain pseudogenes, DNA transposons, and other types of foreign DNA such as transgenes in the germline. The broad targeting capability comes from the highly diverse repertoire of sequences encoded by piRNAs (also called 21U RNAs) in C. elegans. piRNAmediated silencing of transgenes was previously shown to be dependent on HRDE-1,41. To investigate whether the piRNA pathway is required for germline nuclear RNAi activity on the native targets, we performed genome-wide analyses using a piRNA pathway mutant. The C. elegans genome encodes two PIWI family proteins, PRG-1 and PRG-2. Previous studies found that PRG-1 is required for the stability of piRNAs and essential for piRNA activity. By contrast, PRG-2 has very little or no function in the piRNA pathway,56,60. Previous studies found that a subset of the endogenous 22G RNA population is dependent on the piRNA pathway,58. To ask whether regions with PRG-1-dependent endo-siRNAs overlap with the exemplary GRH and GRTS regions, we examined two sets of published small RNAseq data for the prg-1(n4357) mutant and matching wild type animals,61. By using a 3-fold cutoff, we found that only 7.5% and 20.6% of the exemplary GRTS and GRH regions, respectively, had reduced levels of\n[7] damage apoptotic signals that are possibly dependent on the developmental stage of germ cells that encounter splicing collapse. Summary Animals constantly encounter environmental and intrinsic challenges that affect genome/transcriptome integrity, and the ability to grow. For species survival, animals must maintain reproductive fidelity to ensure their genomic content is accurately inherited. To achieve this, when a challenge is experienced, mitotic germ cells arrest to preserve their integrity and function, and meiotic germ cells undergo apoptosis to prevent inheritance of aberrant DNA or to support oocyte growth. When the threat is resolved, the germ line can recover its function by restoring proliferation (Figure 3). Here, we have provided examples of how the C. elegans germline responds to starvation and splicing disruption that reveal the remarkable plasticity of the germline to enable faithful species propagation. Perspectives \u2022 Understanding how germ cells respond to distinct stressors is important for understanding fertility. \u2022 Mitotic germ cells respond to stress by becoming quiescent, and meiotic germ cells respond to stress by activating apoptosis. The C. elegans germline can resume reproduction after a stressor is removed. \u2022 Further investigation is needed to decipher mechanisms through which germline stem cells induce and remain quiescent under different types of stress. Competing Interests The authors declare that there are no competing interests associated with the manuscript. After prolonged starvation, hermaphrodite L4 germ lines shrink due to loss of meiotic germ cells via apoptosis and slowed ovulation, with only quiescent germline stem cells remaining. Splicing collapse pauses/slows the development of hermaphrodite L4 germ lines with mitotic\n[8] malignant morphological changes to the nuclei. Because C. elegans has only one bcl-7, it was a convenient model in which we explore the basic function of the BCL-7 protein to gain insights into the human BCL7 family. F. Some discrepancies between phenotypes found in deletion mutants and RNAi. We sometimes encounter discrepancies between phenotypes observed by RNAi and gene knockout strains. Theoretically, it is conceivable that some RNAi phenotypes are different from those generated by gene knockouts. For example, the redundant function of two homologous genes may indicate that removing only one gene in the genome does not result in any phenotype, but double mutants show some phenotypes. However, RNAi downregulates transcripts from both genes, resulting in visible phenotypes. In different contexts, some genes show very weak or no phenotypes by RNAi but strong phenotypes by gene knockout; such phenomena are described for many genes expressed in nerve cells, especially when RNAi is administered by feeding. To solve this problem, researchers sometimes use transgenic RNAi with neural promoters, which allows dsRNA to be expressed in neurons and to act cell-autonomously, 52) or overexpress the sid-1 (systemic RNA interference defective) gene with a neuronal promoter, 53) which helps the uptake of dsRNA by neuronal cells. In these situations, gene knockdown animals often show apparent phenotypes. It is also expected that maternal-effect genes may show distinct phenotypes between RNAi and gene KO. Homozygous mutants from heterozygous parents (by self-progeny) show weak phenotypes during the early embryonic stages in the gene KO strains and, thus, can be maintained as\n[9] the genomes' (Malone & Hannon, 2009).A decrease or absence of PIWI proteins is correlated with an increased expression of transposons, which have a high potential to cause deleterious effects in their host.Deletion in the piRNA pathway leads to infertility in D. melanogaster, and is embryonically lethal (Brennecke et al, 2007).piRNA complexes are mostly involved in post-transcriptional silencing of transposable elements and other repeat-derived transcripts, but can also be involved in the regulation of other genetic elements in germ line cells. Long-term memory becomes independent of the piRNA trigger but remains dependent on the nuclear RNAi/chromatin pathway.A piRNA-mediated multigenerational epigenetic inheritance mechanism plays a major role in C. elegans nematodes where it can last for up to 20 generations.In contrast to germline cells, in somatic cells gene expression changes affect the next generations only (Ashe et al., 2012). The role of PIWIs in genome stability in germline cells, controlling transposon mobility and uncontrolled transposition, may fit with the error catastrophe concept described by M. Eigen (Eigen, 2002). Transposons move around as small mobile elements within the genome, designated as 'jumping genes' .Their movement can be considered as lock-in of virus-like elements within a cellular genome that lack envelope proteins.These are required for viral life cycles to leave a cell and infect a new one.Transposable elements can be described using computer Word program terminology as cut-and-paste, whereby DNA pieces are cut out and transferred to another location by integration.A more complex mechanism is copy-and-paste, whereby the DNA is transcribed to mRNA, then copied to a DNA transcript by\n", "output": "The C. elegans germline is a remarkable example of an immortal cell lineage, allowing the species to maintain a stable gene pool over generations.

Concluding Remarks The recent literature reviewed here underscores the value of basic epigenetics research in a nematode model. More importantly, recent discoveries pose tantalizing questions for future inquiries. The importance of small RNAs in transgenerational transgene silencing and in aberrant progressive silencing of endogenous genes, which underlies the Mrt phenotype, is well documented. However, the mechanistic links between small RNAs and histone modifying complexes participating in these phenomena are poorly understood and should be investigated in the future. There is still a debate on whether the inappropriate silencing of just one category of repetitive genes, such as the rDNA repeats or histone gene loci, is responsible for the Mrt phenotype of animals lacking piRNAs. It is likely that the silencing of both types of targets contributes to the Mrt sterility. Moreover, it was shown that the Mrt phenotype can be suppressed by insulin signaling pathway mutants [91]. It is not clear whether the insulin signaling pathway regulates small RNAs matching histone genes, rDNA repeats, or something else. It is curious that insulin signaling mutant backgrounds allow a more robust response to experimental RNAi [92] further underscoring the connection to small RNA regulation.

What could serve as a signal for the de novo CENP-A placement in the zygote? Earlier studies from Desai, Strome, and colleagues suggested that the memory of germline transcription is key. Importantly, there are worm antisense siRNAs produced by RdRPs on germline-expressed mRNA templates that are distinct from the silencing siRNAs. They are bound to the Argonaute CSR-1, which is present both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus,85. The nuclear CSR-1 complex is thought to mark genomic regions repelling the silencing chromatin marks,86,87, which correlate with CENP-A placement,86. The mechanism of this is not clear.

Introduction The reproductive system in many animals including vertebrates, insects and nematodes regulates lifespan [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] and the interactions between the reproductive system and lifespan have been extensively studied in Caenorhabditis elegans. When the C. elegans germline is removed by either genetic means or cell ablation, its lifespan can be extended by 60% [1]. The enhanced lifespan is not a simple life-history trade-off between reproduction and somatic tissue maintenance because C. elegans rendered sterile by complete gonad ablation or other manipulations live only as long as C. elegans with intact germline [1]. The role of gonadal tissue in regulating pro-longevity or pathogen resistance genes has not been studied at a whole-genome level. Therefore, to understand the contribution of gonadal tissue to lifespan and immunity regulating genes, and the role of the innate immune system towards lifespan extension in germlinedeficient C. elegans at a genome-wide scale, we combined laser cell ablation to kill the germline and gonad precursor cells, with whole genome microarrays, followed by an RNAi knockdown screen to identify mechanistic processes involved in both longevity and immunity.

Since then, RNAi has proven to be a powerful experimental tool to gain insight into gene function in multiple organisms [1]. During RNAi in C. elegans, dsRNA serves as a trigger for sequence-specific degradation of mRNA as a mechanism of gene silencing [2,3]. The dsRNA is first cleaved into short-interfering (si) RNAs by a complex containing Dicer, an RNase III family endoribonuclease. These siRNAs are then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where they guide recognition of the target-complementary mRNA, which is subsequently cleaved and degraded. Intriguingly, only a few molecules of dsRNA are sufficient to direct degradation of a much larger population of mRNAs [4,5]. This is due to an amplification process mediated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs). The RdRPs use siRNAs derived from Dicer-complex processing as primers to produce more dsRNA, with the mature endogenous mRNA as a template. These newly synthesized dsRNA molecules may also feed back into the Dicer complex to be cleaved into additional siRNA (for review, see [4,5]). In C. elegans, four RdRP homologs have been identified to date: EGO-1 and RRF-1, -2, and -3. EGO-1 and RRF-1 have been implicated in the amplification of exogenous RNAi [6,7], whereas RRF-3 is required for the production and/or stabilization of a subset of endogenous siRNAs [7,8].

We then asked whether loss of prg-1 had any effect on the germline nuclear RNAi-mediated heterochromatin response and transcriptional silencing at the native target sites. For this we performed H3K9me3 and Pol II (S2) ChIP-seq experiments using the prg-1(n4357) mutant animals. The results showed that loss of PRG-1 had virtually no effect on the H3K9me3 or Pol II occupancy profiles on the native targets of germline nuclear RNAi ( Figure 6B and C), indicating that germline nuclear RNAi in C. elegans does not require the piRNA pathway. Retrotransposon silencing By taking a combined genetic, biochemical, and computational approach, we identified a distinct set of genomic regions that are naturally targeted by germline nuclear RNAi for transcriptional silencing and/or heterochromatin formation in C. elegans. The enrichment of retrotransposon elements in these regions suggests that germline nuclear RNAi evolved as a genome defense mechanism against this type of mobile DNA. Our detailed wholegenome profiling of Pol II occupancy and pre-mRNA indicates that, first, the HRDE-1-targeted retrotransposons in C. elegans are intrinsically active in transcription. Second, germline nuclear RNAi-mediated transcriptional silencing at these regions occurs prior to (or at) the formation of the transcriptional preinitiation complex.

The broad targeting capability comes from the highly diverse repertoire of sequences encoded by piRNAs (also called 21U RNAs) in C. elegans. piRNAmediated silencing of transgenes was previously shown to be dependent on HRDE-1,41.

Concluding Remarks The recent literature reviewed here underscores the value of basic epigenetics research in a nematode model. More importantly, recent discoveries pose tantalizing questions for future inquiries. The importance of small RNAs in transgenerational transgene silencing and in aberrant progressive silencing of endogenous genes, which underlies the Mrt phenotype, is well documented. However, the mechanistic links between small RNAs and histone modifying complexes participating in these phenomena are poorly understood and should be investigated in the future. There is still a debate on whether the inappropriate silencing of just one category of repetitive genes, such as the rDNA repeats or histone gene loci, is responsible for the Mrt phenotype of animals lacking piRNAs. It is likely that the silencing of both types of targets contributes to the Mrt sterility. Moreover, it was shown that the Mrt phenotype can be suppressed by insulin signaling pathway mutants [91]. It is not clear whether the insulin signaling pathway regulates small RNAs matching histone genes, rDNA repeats, or something else. It is curious that insulin signaling mutant backgrounds allow a more robust response to experimental RNAi [92] further underscoring the connection to small RNA regulation.

When the C. elegans germline is removed by either genetic means or cell ablation, its lifespan can be extended by 60% [1]. The enhanced lifespan is not a simple life-history trade-off between reproduction and somatic tissue maintenance because C. elegans rendered sterile by complete gonad ablation or other manipulations live only as long as C. elegans with intact germline [1].

Therefore, to understand the contribution of gonadal tissue to lifespan and immunity regulating genes, and the role of the innate immune system towards lifespan extension in germlinedeficient C. elegans at a genome-wide scale, we combined laser cell ablation to kill the germline and gonad precursor cells, with whole genome microarrays, followed by an RNAi knockdown screen to identify mechanistic processes involved in both longevity and immunity.

Since then, RNAi has proven to be a powerful experimental tool to gain insight into gene function in multiple organisms [1]. During RNAi in C. elegans, dsRNA serves as a trigger for sequence-specific degradation of mRNA as a mechanism of gene silencing [2,3]. The dsRNA is first cleaved into short-interfering (si) RNAs by a complex containing Dicer, an RNase III family endoribonuclease. These siRNAs are then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where they guide recognition of the target-complementary mRNA, which is subsequently cleaved and degraded. Intriguingly, only a few molecules of dsRNA are sufficient to direct degradation of a much larger population of mRNAs [4,5]. This is due to an amplification process mediated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs). The RdRPs use siRNAs derived from Dicer-complex processing as primers to produce more dsRNA, with the mature endogenous mRNA as a template. These newly synthesized dsRNA molecules may also feed back into the Dicer complex to be cleaved into additional siRNA (for review, see [4,5]). In C. elegans, four RdRP homologs have been identified to date: EGO-1 and RRF-1, -2, and -3. EGO-1 and RRF-1 have been implicated in the amplification of exogenous RNAi [6,7], whereas RRF-3 is required for the production and/or stabilization of a subset of endogenous siRNAs [7,8].

Mice were assessed for their body weight every 3 days throughout the whole study. Skin tissues were used to evaluate the oxidative stress parameters, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 15, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).

We found that loss of eri-6/7 had no silencing defects on the natural targets of germline nuclear RNAi [data not shown]. The piRNA pathway is not required for germline nuclear RNAi responses at the native targets The piRNA pathway in C. elegans plays an important role in silencing certain pseudogenes, DNA transposons, and other types of foreign DNA such as transgenes in the germline [55][56][57][58][59]. The broad targeting capability comes from the highly diverse repertoire of sequences encoded by piRNAs (also called 21U RNAs) in C. elegans. piRNAmediated silencing of transgenes was previously shown to be dependent on HRDE-1 [40,41]. To investigate whether the piRNA pathway is required for germline nuclear RNAi activity on the native targets, we performed genome-wide analyses using a piRNA pathway mutant.

Retrotransposon silencing By taking a combined genetic, biochemical, and computational approach, we identified a distinct set of genomic regions that are naturally targeted by germline nuclear RNAi for transcriptional silencing and/or heterochromatin formation in C. elegans. The enrichment of retrotransposon elements in these regions suggests that germline nuclear RNAi evolved as a genome defense mechanism against this type of mobile DNA. Our detailed wholegenome profiling of Pol II occupancy and pre-mRNA indicates that, first, the HRDE-1-targeted retrotransposons in C. elegans are intrinsically active in transcription.

The data suggest that endo siRNAs, acting via the nuclear RNAi machinery, may contribute to chromatin compaction in the C. elegans germline. Here we show that two additional components of the C. elegans nuclear RNAi machinery are required for normal chromatin compaction and chromatin organization in the germline, supporting the model that endo siRNAs regulate chromatin compaction in nematodes. In addition, we show that siRNAs are sufficient to direct chromatin compaction in the soma and that this process requires a nuclear RNAi Ago (NRDE-3) as well as the HP1-like factor HPL-2. Our results support a model in which nuclear-localized small regulatory RNAs are important mediators of chromatin organization and compaction in C. elegans. Results endogenous siRNAs may compact germline chromatin. Small regulatory RNAs, such as siRNAs or piRNAs, have been linked to heterochromatin formation in many eukaryotes, suggesting that small RNAs may act as specificity factors, acting via Watson-Crick base pairing, for directing heterochromatin formation and chromatin compaction in many eukaryotes 27 . In C. elegans, the GHKL ATPase MORC-1, a component of the nuclear RNAi machinery, promotes chromatin organization and chromatin compaction in adult C. elegans germ cells, suggesting that siRNAs, acting via the nuclear RNAi machinery and MORC-1, also regulate chromatin compaction in C. elegans 40 . To further test this idea, we asked if two other components of the C. elegans nuclear RNAi machinery: the germline expressed nuclear RNAi AGO HRDE-1, and the nuclear RNAi factor NRDE-2, were, like MORC-1, needed for chromatin organization\n[1] after the initial dsRNA exposure. Most of the published studies rely on phenotype or protein expression to measure the silencing state. As such, a lack of transcriptional repression can be masked by an active classical RNAi (post-transcriptional silencing). In the case of the endogenous nuclear RNAi targets (guided by endo-siRNAs), the establishment phase likely occurs soon after the first invasion of an LTR retrotransposon or other types of repetitive DNA into the C. elegans genome. We and others previously found that the transcription of these endogenous targets are highly active in the hrde-1 and other nuclear RNAi mutants (Buckley et al., 2012;Ni et al., 2014Ni et al., , 2016, indicating that these targets still contain their transcriptional activating cis-regulatory elements. It remains an open question how soon a transposable element is silenced after its initial integration into the genome. Transgene has a strong tendency to be silenced in the C. elegans germline (Kelly et al., 1997). Interestingly, the silencing does not occur immediately after the transformation but gradually reaches the highest level over a course of multiple generations (Kelly et al., 1997), suggesting that the establishment of silencing at a transgene is a transgenerational process. The establishment process at the endogenous nuclear RNAi targets is highly important to our knowledge of genome surveillance. However, this process is largely elusive due to a lack of experimental system. Published work on the endogenous targets have been limited on the maintenance phase. In this study, we developed different strategies to examine the establishment process of silencing for an exogenous\n[2] tail of CENP-A,81. Surprisingly, the N-terminal tail is dispensable for mitotic divisions during late embryogenesis, larval development, and germline proliferation. Thus, there are distinct steps of initiation and maintenance governing the epigenetic inheritance of CENP-A between generations in C. elegans. What could serve as a signal for the de novo CENP-A placement in the zygote? Earlier studies from Desai, Strome, and colleagues suggested that the memory of germline transcription is key. Importantly, there are worm antisense siRNAs produced by RdRPs on germline-expressed mRNA templates that are distinct from the silencing siRNAs. They are bound to the Argonaute CSR-1, which is present both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus,85. The nuclear CSR-1 complex is thought to mark genomic regions repelling the silencing chromatin marks,86,87, which correlate with CENP-A placement,86. The mechanism of this is not clear. If this scenario is correct, then CENP-A incorporation should proceed by default. There is also the possibility of both repelling and attracting marks guiding the de novo CENP-A pattern establishment. Environment In C. elegans, \"silencing\" chromatin marks are enriched on autosome arms whereas the essential genes, including most germline genes, are located at the centers of autosomes (Figure 4b). Therefore, it is thought that the chromosome location (i.e., active or closed chromatin environment) determines whether the gene is expressed in the germline or not. Surprisingly, this is not the whole story. Fr\u00f8kjaer-Jensen and co-authors discovered periodic DNA sequence patterns, namely 10-base pair periodic An/Tn-clusters (PATCs), which are correlated with germline expression of\n[3] A Functional Genomic Screen for Evolutionarily Conserved Genes Required for Lifespan and Immunity in Germline-Deficient C. elegans The reproductive system regulates lifespan in insects, nematodes and vertebrates. In Caenorhabditis elegans removal of germline increases lifespan by 60% which is dependent upon insulin signaling, nuclear hormone signaling, autophagy and fat metabolism and their microRNA-regulators. Germline-deficient C. elegans are also more resistant to various bacterial pathogens but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Firstly, we demonstrate that previously identified genes that regulate the extended lifespan of germline-deficient C. elegans (daf-2, daf-16, daf-12, tcer-1, mir-7.1 and nhr-80) are also essential for resistance to the pathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila. We then use a novel unbiased approach combining laser cell ablation, whole genome microarrays, RNAi screening and exposure to X. nematophila to generate a comprehensive genome-wide catalog of genes potentially required for increased lifespan and innate immunity in germline-deficient C. elegans. We find 3,440 genes to be upregulated in C. elegans germline-deficient animals in a gonad dependent manner, which are significantly enriched for genes involved in insulin signaling, fatty acid desaturation, translation elongation and proteasome complex function. Using RNAi against a subset of 150 candidate genes selected from the microarray results, we show that the upregulated genes such as transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO, the PTEN homolog lipid phosphatase DAF-18 and several components of the proteasome complex (rpn-6.1, rpn-7, rpn-9, rpn-10, rpt-6, pbs-3 and pbs-6) are essential for both lifespan and immunity of germline deficient animals. We also identify a novel role for genes including par-5 and T12G3.6 in both lifespan-extension and\n[4] C. elegans rrf-1 Mutations Maintain RNAi Efficiency in the Soma in Addition to the Germline Gene inactivation through RNA interference (RNAi) has proven to be a valuable tool for studying gene function in C. elegans. When combined with tissue-specific gene inactivation methods, RNAi has the potential to shed light on the function of a gene in distinct tissues. In this study we characterized C. elegans rrf-1 mutants to determine their ability to process RNAi in various tissues. These mutants have been widely used in RNAi studies to assess the function of genes specifically in the C. elegans germline. Upon closer analysis, we found that two rrf-1 mutants carrying different loss-of-function alleles were capable of processing RNAi targeting several somatically expressed genes. Specifically, we observed that the intestine was able to process RNAi triggers efficiently, whereas cells in the hypodermis showed partial susceptibility to RNAi in rrf-1 mutants. Other somatic tissues in rrf-1 mutants, such as the muscles and the somatic gonad, appeared resistant to RNAi. In addition to these observations, we found that the rrf-1(pk1417) mutation induced the expression of several transgenic arrays, including the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Unexpectedly, rrf-1(pk1417) mutants showed increased endogenous expression of the DAF-16 target gene sod-3; however, the lifespan and thermo-tolerance of rrf-1(pk1417) mutants were similar to those of wild-type animals. In sum, these data show that rrf-1 mutants display several phenotypes not previously appreciated, including broader tissue-specific RNAi-processing capabilities, and our results underscore the need for careful characterization of tissue-specific RNAi tools.

It is well established that germline-mediated longevity requires the activity of the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 and a lipophilic hormone/steroid signaling pathway comprising DAF-9 and DAF-12,7,13,37.We found that these canonical germline pathway components also play a critical role in the increases in lifespan that derive from cell cycle inhibition (Figure 2C and D, Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 2C and D).Interestingly, the dramatic lifespan extension associated with knockdown of cye-1 and cdk-2 was not fully eliminated in two daf-16 null mutants indicating that DAF-16 is central for the influence of cell cycle regulators on longevity, but\n[6] Nuclear RNAi maintains heritable gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans RNA interference (RNAi) is heritable in Caenorhabditis elegans; the progeny of C. elegans exposed to dsRNA inherit the ability to silence genes that were targeted by RNAi in the previous generation. Here we investigate the mechanism of RNAi inheritance in C. elegans. We show that exposure of animals to dsRNA results in the heritable expression of siRNAs and the heritable deposition of histone 3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) marks in progeny. siRNAs are detectable before the appearance of H3K9me marks, suggesting that chromatin marks are not directly inherited but, rather, reestablished in inheriting progeny. Interestingly, H3K9me marks appear more prominently in inheriting progeny than in animals directly exposed to dsRNA, suggesting that germ-line transmission of silencing signals may enhance the efficiency of siRNA-directed H3K9me. Finally, we show that the nuclear RNAi (Nrde) pathway maintains heritable RNAi silencing in C. elegans. The Argonaute (Ago) NRDE-3 associates with heritable siRNAs and, acting in conjunction with the nuclear RNAi factors NRDE-1, NRDE-2, and NRDE-4, promotes siRNA expression in inheriting progeny. These results demonstrate that siRNA expression is heritable in C. elegans and define an RNAi pathway that promotes the maintenance of RNAi silencing and siRNA expression in the progeny of animals exposed to dsRNA.\n[7] concentrations in the injection mix result in more-frequent germline expression but inclusion of PATC-rich carrier DNA appears to be toxic. Although we primarily focused on determining a set of applicable rules for improved germline expression, two of our results provide biological insight into requirements for transgene expression. First, there is no strict requirement for protein-coding sequences from endogenous genes (smu-1 or smu-2), suggesting that PATCs and the csr-1 (which depends on homology to coding regions) pathway are complementary. Second, array silencing in the germline was proposed to result from divergent transcription and dsRNA intermediates leading to RNAi-mediated silencing 48 . This model is difficult to reconcile with the observation that higher plasmid concentrations increase germline expression unless PATCs prevent antisense transcription. Early introns and backbone removal increase germline expression. Transposons are detected in the yeast Cryptococcus Neoformans by nuclear RNAi machinery that scans for suboptimal introns 49 . In C. elegans, a similar mechanism has been proposed, with introns acting as a barrier to repressive nuclear RNAi pathways that act via the EMB-4 RNA helicase 15 . Perhaps, N-terminal gfp-tagged genes are prone to silencing owing to unusual codon-usage or intron structure, specifically at the 5\u2032 end of genes? To explore this possibility, and the general requirement for introns to enable germline expression, we generated chimeric transgenes consisting of smu-1 genomic DNA and cDNA with a C-terminal gfp tag (Fig. 3a). We observed robust germline fluorescence from transgenes with introns at the 5\u2032 end of the gene but virtually no expression from a smu-1 cDNA or\n[8] The spatial and temporal dynamics of the nuclear RNAi-targeted RNA transcripts in Caenorhabditis elegans Small RNA-guided chromatin silencing, also referred to as nuclear RNAi, plays an essential role in genome surveillance in eukaryotes and provides a unique paradigm to explore the complexity in RNA-mediated chromatin regulation and transgenerational epigenetics. A well-recognized paradox in this research area is that transcription of the target loci is necessary for the initiation and maintenance of the silencing at the same loci. How the two opposing activities (transcriptional activation and repression) are coordinated during animal development is poorly understood. To resolve this gap, we took single-molecule RNA imaging, deep-sequencing, and genetic approaches towards delineating the developmental regulation and subcellular localization of RNA transcripts of two exemplary endogenous germline nuclear RNAi targets in C. elegans, Cer3 and Cer8 LTR retrotransposons. By examining the wild type and a collection of mutant strains, we found that transcription and silencing cycle of Cer3 and Cer8 is tightly coupled with the early embryogenesis and germline mitotic and meiotic cell cycles. Strikingly, Cer3 and Cer8 transcripts are exclusively localized in the nuclei of germ cells in both wild type and germline nuclear RNAi-defective mutant animals. RNA-sequencing analysis found that this nuclear enrichment feature is a general feature for the endogenous targets of the germline nuclear RNAi pathway. In addition, the germline and somatic repressions of Cer3 have different genetic requirement for the three H3K9 histone methyltransferases, MET-2, SET-25, and SET-32, in conjunction with the nuclear Argonaute protein WAGO-9/HRDE-1. These results provide a first comprehensive cellular and developmental\n[9] germline nuclear RNAi on the expression of a neighboring gene. We found that loss of eri-6/7 had no silencing defects on the natural targets of germline nuclear RNAi [data not shown. The piRNA pathway is not required for germline nuclear RNAi responses at the native targets The piRNA pathway in C. elegans plays an important role in silencing certain pseudogenes, DNA transposons, and other types of foreign DNA such as transgenes in the germline. The broad targeting capability comes from the highly diverse repertoire of sequences encoded by piRNAs (also called 21U RNAs) in C. elegans. piRNAmediated silencing of transgenes was previously shown to be dependent on HRDE-1,41. To investigate whether the piRNA pathway is required for germline nuclear RNAi activity on the native targets, we performed genome-wide analyses using a piRNA pathway mutant. The C. elegans genome encodes two PIWI family proteins, PRG-1 and PRG-2. Previous studies found that PRG-1 is required for the stability of piRNAs and essential for piRNA activity. By contrast, PRG-2 has very little or no function in the piRNA pathway,56,60. Previous studies found that a subset of the endogenous 22G RNA population is dependent on the piRNA pathway,58. To ask whether regions with PRG-1-dependent endo-siRNAs overlap with the exemplary GRH and GRTS regions, we examined two sets of published small RNAseq data for the prg-1(n4357) mutant and matching wild type animals,61. By using a 3-fold cutoff, we found that only 7.5% and 20.6% of the exemplary GRTS and GRH regions, respectively, had reduced levels of\n", "output": "C. elegans germlines gain their immortal character when nuclear RNAi is activated through the action of various components of the nuclear RNAi machinery, including the germline-expressed nuclear RNAi AGO HRDE-1, the nuclear RNAi factor NRDE-2, and the HP1-like factor HPL-2 [0].

Upper motor neuron (UMN) impairment in ALS can be detected from clinical signs such as brisk reflexes and spasticity; however, the masking effect of the lower motor neuron involvement that reduces muscle strength and reflexes may make it hard to reveal clinical evidence of pyramidal involvement.

A myotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron disorder that entails degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons, 1 producing fasciculation, muscle wasting and weakness, increased spasticity, and hyperreflexia. Upper motor neuron (UMN) impairment in ALS can be detected from clinical signs such as brisk reflexes and spasticity; however, the masking effect of the lower motor neuron involvement that reduces muscle strength and reflexes may make it hard to reveal clinical evidence of pyramidal involvement. Electrophysiologic investigations, such as prolongation of central motor conduction time in motor-evoked potentials in transcranial magnetic stimulation, may detect the upper motor neuron involvement, but results are conflicting and these measures are not a sensitive tool or a useful indicator of disease severity or prognosis. Therefore, a robust in vivo biomarker of UMN impairment, though desirable, 5 is not available. The hallmark of UMN pathology in ALS is depopulation of the Betz cells in the motor cortex and axonal loss within the descend-ing motor pathway associated with myelin pallor and gliosis of the corticospinal tracts. 6 Conversely, also, characteristic of ALS pathology similar to that in other neurodegenerative disorders is the occurrence of a", "title": ""}, {"id": "8478951", "source": "pes2o_v2", "retrieval text": "disease-associated mutations.Together, these findings all indicate that neurotransmission in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be under constant suppressive pressure in the form of biochemical and molecular pathways that impair neurotransmitter release, and this might play a key role in driving degenerative mechanisms.

Conclusion and key messages The past three decades of attempting to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by suppressing neuronal activation across the whole nervous system has demonstrated that our theories of the disease need to be revisited.The 'dying forward' hypothesis remains an attractive explanation for pathogenesis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.In support of this, studies on ALS patients and preclinical animal models converge on the concept that the motor cortex and the upper motor neurons display hallmarks of increased excitability either in the early stages of ALS or in the presymptomatic phase of familial ALS. 44While motor cortex hyperexcitability is clearly associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the precise molecular processes underlying excitotoxicity warrants further assessment.Mechanisms responding to potential perturbations in excitability need to be differentiated from pathological drivers of", "retrieval score": "1.3819134", "text": "disease-associated mutations.Together, these findings all indicate that neurotransmission in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be under constant suppressive pressure in the form of biochemical and molecular pathways that impair neurotransmitter release, and this might play a key role in driving degenerative mechanisms.

With stimulus intensity at threshold and an interstimulus interval of 30 ms, normal subjects (n = 20) demonstrated marked inhibition with a mean test/conditioning EPSP ratio of 13.8% (range 0\u201351%) and in 7 subjects the ratio was 0 (100% inhibition). In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) the ratio was 133% (range 64\u2013267%), P < 0.001. Fifty percent of patients had a test/conditioning EPSP ratio greater than 100% (0 inhibition). The abnormalities were independent of disease severity, bulbar versus spinal ALS, more prominent upper versus lower motor neuron findings, and disease duration. Normal inhibition occurred in 3 individuals, 1 each with multiple sclerosis, Kennedy's syndrome, and monomelic amyotrophy. We speculate that the marked loss of inhibition seen in all patients with ALS, which may be unique to this disorder, reflects loss of inhibitory modulation of the corticomotoneuron and could result in their chronic excitatory drive and eventual demise. \u00a9 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n[3] The size distribution of neurons in the motor cortex in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis The motor cortex of eight patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and nine control subjects was used in the study.

No significant differences were found in any of the estimates. In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies show a decrease in the concentration of neuronal markers. We expected to find changes in perikaryon and/or nuclei neuronal volume because the total neuron number is unchanged in ALS compared with control subjects.

A myotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron disorder that entails degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons, 1 producing fasciculation, muscle wasting and weakness, increased spasticity, and hyperreflexia. Upper motor neuron (UMN) impairment in ALS can be detected from clinical signs such as brisk reflexes and spasticity; however, the masking effect of the lower motor neuron involvement that reduces muscle strength and reflexes may make it hard to reveal clinical evidence of pyramidal involvement. Electrophysiologic investigations, such as prolongation of central motor conduction time in motor-evoked potentials in transcranial magnetic stimulation, may detect the upper motor neuron involvement, but results are conflicting and these measures are not a sensitive tool or a useful indicator of disease severity or prognosis. Therefore, a robust in vivo biomarker of UMN impairment, though desirable, 5 is not available. The hallmark of UMN pathology in ALS is depopulation of the Betz cells in the motor cortex and axonal loss within the descend-ing motor pathway associated with myelin pallor and gliosis of the corticospinal tracts. 6 Conversely, also, characteristic of ALS pathology similar to that in other neurodegenerative disorders is the occurrence of a\n[5] disease-associated mutations.Together, these findings all indicate that neurotransmission in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be under constant suppressive pressure in the form of biochemical and molecular pathways that impair neurotransmitter release, and this might play a key role in driving degenerative mechanisms.

The mean motor unit action potential duration, amplitude, and polyphasia were increased in patients compared to controls but did not change during 9 months of disease progression. The enlarged motor units in patients were negatively correlated to the muscle force and positively correlated to muscle fatigability. Furthermore, after a mean follow\u2010up period of 9 months, the decline in force\u2010generating capacity of the anterior tibial muscle in patients (twitch tension by 37.5 \u00b1 11.2%, TF by 30.6 \u00b1 7.4%) was greater than the decline in the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (21.1 \u00b1 8.8%, P < 0.05), suggesting a relative dissociation between electrical and mechanical properties. In conclusion, the enlarged motor units in patients with ALS are mechanically less efficient and fatigue relatively more than in healthy muscles, possibly due to an abnormality that is primarily distal to the muscle membrane. \u00a9 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n[7] lateral sclerosis is highlighted by the finding that ablating them reverses the hyperexcitability phenotype of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. 89 interneurons also display changes that may serve to increase the excitability of upper motor neurons.In particular, corticocortical neurons in the motor cortex of SOD1 G93A mice display increased intrinsic excitability. 668 Although it is evident that upstream changes to upper motor neurons likely play an important role in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more information is needed to dissect out if these are causal in upper motor neuron pathophysiology.Also, similarly to upper motor neurons, the question of how their activity changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains unanswered. Pre-motor interneurons and spinal cord networks Although upper motor neurons can form direct connections with lower motor neurons, and thus directly drive glutamate-dependent synaptic transmission, their influence is ultimately dictated by networks of spinal cord interneurons.As such, sources of excitotoxic pressure onto lower motor neurons must always consider the effects of spinal cord network activity and, specifically, the contributions of premotor interneurons.Most studies examining spinal interneurons in patients or preclinical animal models report loss of interneurons as the disease progresses.In some cases, the loss of interneurons precedes loss of lower motor neurons 100,101 whereas in others, the loss (or magnitude of loss) occurs afterwards 102,103 or appears to be concomitant. 102,104,105This frank loss of interneurons is likely to result in broad changes to the activity of spinal cord networks and, ultimately, lower motor neurons.Consistent with this notion, presynaptic inputs onto lower motor neurons are often impacted in disease.In\n[8] The stimulus\u2013response curve and motor unit variability in normal subjects and subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis The behavior and stability of motor units (MUs) in response to electrical stimulation of different intensities can be assessed with the stimulus\u2013response curve, which is a graphical representation of the size of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in relation to stimulus intensity. To examine MU characteristics across the whole stimulus range, the variability of CMAP responses to electrical stimulation, and the differences that occur between normal and disease states, the curve was studied in 11 normal subjects and 16 subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In normal subjects, the curve showed a gradual increase in CMAP size with increasing stimulus intensity, although one or two discrete steps were sometimes observed in the upper half of the curve, indicating the activation of large MUs at higher intensities. In ALS subjects, large discrete steps, due to loss of MUs and collateral sprouting, were frequently present. Variability of the CMAP responses was greater than baseline variability, indicating variability of MU responses, and at certain levels this variability was up to 100 \u03bcVms. The stimulus\u2013response curve shows differences between normal and ALS subjects and provides information on MU activation and variability throughout the curve. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Muscle Nerve, 2006\n[9] Revisiting distinct nerve excitability patterns in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating neurodegenerative disease, characterized by loss of central and peripheral motor neurones. Although the disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, axonal hyperexcitability is a commonly observed feature that has been suggested to reflect an early pathophysiological step linked to the neurodegenerative cascade. Therefore, it is important to clarify the mechanisms causing axonal hyperexcitability and how these relate to the clinical characteristics of patients. Measures derived directly from a nerve excitability recording are frequently used as study endpoints, even though their biophysical basis is difficult to deduce. Mathematical models can aid in the interpretation, but are only reliable when applied to group-averaged recordings. Consequently, model estimates of membrane properties cannot be compared to clinical characteristics or treatment effects in individual patients, posing a considerable limitation in heterogeneous diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To address these challenges, we revisited nerve excitability using a novel pattern-analysis-based approach (principal component analysis). We evaluated disease-specific patterns of excitability changes and established their biophysical origins. Based on the observed patterns, we developed novel compound measures of excitability that facilitate the implementation of this approach in clinical settings We found that excitability changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (n = 161, median disease duration = 11 months) were characterized by four unique patterns compared to controls (n = 50, age-gender matched). These four patterns were best explained by changes in resting membrane potential (modulated by Na+/K + -currents), slow potassium- and sodium-currents (modulated by their gating\n", "output": "Motor neurons from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) exhibit electrophysiological changes compared to healthy individuals.

It is now well documented that HIV-1 can be transferred very efficiently from cell-tocell, most likely upon induction of so-called virological synapses (VSs), sites of transient adhesion between infected (producer) and uninfected (target) cells [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Upon formation of the VS, viral budding is polarized towards the target cell, and the virus is thought to be released into the tight synaptic cleft where it appears to be at least partially protected from neutralizing antibodies [3]. Clearly, how the VS is formed and organized is an important question. Like immunological synapse (IS) formation, VS formation likely requires the concerted action of numerous cellular factors, several of which are also utilized for IS formation. Indeed it has been proposed that HIV-1 infection, followed by the expression of viral proteins, favors the formation of VSs at the expense of IS formation (e.g. [8], reviewed in [9]). However, we are only at a very early stage of understanding the relative distribution and function of viral and cellular elements during the formation, maintenance and disengagement of the VS. Specifically, while some studies show that VS formation and virus transfer is primarily driven by Env-CD4 interactions [2,3,10], other cellular components involved are only beginning to be unveiled.

Tetraspanins belong to a growing family of transmembrane proteins, with over 40 family members identified in mammals, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans (1). Similar to other transmembrane 4 superfamily proteins, tetraspanins contain four transmembrane domains. Mutations of tetraspanin genes are associated with various degenerative diseases. For example, the human tetraspanin, TMS4SF/A15, is associated with mental retardation (2); furthermore over 60 mutations of the photoreceptor-specific tetraspanin, peripherin-2, result in a variety of retinal degenerative disorders (3). The unique structural and functional domains of this protein family includes four to six highly conserved cysteine residues linked into two to three disulfide bonds in a highly conserved EC-2 domain. Mutations within this domain result in retinal degeneration and mental retardation. Tetraspanins also contain polar residues in the first, third, and fourth transmembrane domains postulated to be involved in protein-protein interactions necessary to form signaling complexes (4 -8).

CD81 has also been implicated in human leukemia virus 1 fusion but not HIV 1 fusion. More recently, both CD9 and CD81 have been shown to promote muscle cell fusion (11). The mechanism by which these proteins participate in fusion is not clear; however, the notion that these tetraspanins may have intrinsic fusogenic function has not been ruled out. Photoreceptor cells contain a unique set of tetraspanin proteins known as peripherin-2 and its nonglycosylated homologue rom-1 (12)(13)(14)(15)(16). Purified peripherin-2 promotes membrane fusion with ROS plasma membrane in a cell-free assay system (17,18). This system serves as a model for two key fusion-dependent events in rod cell renewal: disk morphogenesis and disk shedding (19). Fusion is mediated through a fusion peptide domain within the C-terminal domain of peripherin-2 corresponding to residues 312-326. The amphiphilic, \u2423-helical structure of the fusion peptide is necessary for the formation of a fusogenic oligomer of the peptide to promote the requisite steps in membrane fusion (20,21). Homology among human, murine, bovine, Xenopus, and avian forms of the protein in a region upstream of the fusion peptide, residues 294 -314, suggests functional importance within this region of the C terminus.

Early experiments [1,2] by Glicksman and coworkers on succinonitrile (SCN) provided the first benchmarks for theoretical models of dendritic growth.

Upon formation of the VS, viral budding is polarized towards the target cell, and the virus is thought to be released into the tight synaptic cleft where it appears to be at least partially protected from neutralizing antibodies [3]. Clearly, how the VS is formed and organized is an important question. Like immunological synapse (IS) formation, VS formation likely requires the concerted action of numerous cellular factors, several of which are also utilized for IS formation. Indeed it has been proposed that HIV-1 infection, followed by the expression of viral proteins, favors the formation of VSs at the expense of IS formation (e.g. [8], reviewed in [9]). However, we are only at a very early stage of understanding the relative distribution and function of viral and cellular elements during the formation, maintenance and disengagement of the VS.

Tetraspanins belong to a growing family of transmembrane proteins, with over 40 family members identified in mammals, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans (1). Similar to other transmembrane 4 superfamily proteins, tetraspanins contain four transmembrane domains. Mutations of tetraspanin genes are associated with various degenerative diseases. For example, the human tetraspanin, TMS4SF/A15, is associated with mental retardation (2); furthermore over 60 mutations of the photoreceptor-specific tetraspanin, peripherin-2, result in a variety of retinal degenerative disorders (3). The unique structural and functional domains of this protein family includes four to six highly conserved cysteine residues linked into two to three disulfide bonds in a highly conserved EC-2 domain.

CD81 has also been implicated in human leukemia virus 1 fusion but not HIV 1 fusion. More recently, both CD9 and CD81 have been shown to promote muscle cell fusion (11). The mechanism by which these proteins participate in fusion is not clear; however, the notion that these tetraspanins may have intrinsic fusogenic function has not been ruled out. Photoreceptor cells contain a unique set of tetraspanin proteins known as peripherin-2 and its nonglycosylated homologue rom-1 (12)(13)(14)(15)(16). Purified peripherin-2 promotes membrane fusion with ROS plasma membrane in a cell-free assay system (17,18). This system serves as a model for two key fusion-dependent events in rod cell renewal: disk morphogenesis and disk shedding (19). Fusion is mediated through a fusion peptide domain within the C-terminal domain of peripherin-2 corresponding to residues 312-326. The amphiphilic, \u2423-helical structure of the fusion peptide is necessary for the formation of a fusogenic oligomer of the peptide to promote the requisite steps in membrane fusion (20,21). Homology among human, murine, bovine, Xenopus, and avian forms of the protein in a region upstream of the fusion peptide, residues 294 -314, suggests functional importance within this region of the C terminus. A P296T substitution in this region was previously shown to enhance fusion, although the contribution of subunit assembly to the fusogenicity of that mutant was not addressed (22).

We report new results on self-similar evolution in both the experiments and simulations. We find that the time dependent scaling of our low undercooling simulations displays a cross-over scaling from a regime different than that characterizing Laplacian growth to steady-state growth. Recent computational and experimental advances in dendritic growth offer a realistic prospect for a first principles understanding of solidification microstructure formation. Early experiments [1,2] by Glicksman and coworkers on succinonitrile (SCN) provided the first benchmarks for theoretical models of dendritic growth. Comparison of experiments with theory has been difficult, however, since experiments were influenced by convection effects and performed at low undercooling using materials with low anisotropy, parameters for which computation is difficult. Such calculations can nevertheless be performed in two-dimensions (2D) with state-of-theart numerical methods combining so-called phase-field models [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] and adaptive-mesh refinement [14][15][16]. In the most recent round of experiments [17,18] Glicksman and coworkers have reported observations on Pivalic Acid (PVA), whose higher anisotropy brings the benchmarks closer to the parameter range of theoretical computations.

Evidence from model organisms and inherited human diseases has provided insight into tetraspanin functions in vivo.Previously we demonstrated that a reduction in tetraspanin tsp-15 function, led to exoskeletal deficiencies and lesions in the maintenance of barrier function.The exoskeleton (cuticle) of C. elegans is mainly composed of collagen, synthesized and secreted from the apical surface of underlying epidermal cells (hypodermis).In the current study, we have identified a series of mutations in genes that are components of the nematode DUOX system.Based on our evidence, we propose that tetraspanin is a newly identified regulatory component of the DUOX system for H 2 O 2 production. Identification of DUOX system mutants resembling the tsp-15 mutant The splicing error mutation, sv15, within tsp-15 causes a reduction in function of tsp-15.We characterized other tsp-15 mutants and found that those with deletions within tsp-15 coding regions were lethal to embryos (Table 1, Figure S1, Table S1, Video S1).We screened for novel mutants similar to the tsp-15 hypomorph mutant to obtain clues for the tsp-15 mutant phenotype.We have shown that tsp-15(sv15) mutants have a distinct blister phenotype compared with classical bli mutants, that were classified by dpy-7p::gfp expression (Figure 1B).Both N2 and OB43 imIs1[dpy-7p::gfp strains were mutated and screened to exclude typical bli mutants.We isolated thirteen alleles\n[1] including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and published data showed that expression of this protein was reduced in the brain specimens of patients diagnosed with ASD, Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 28The Tetraspanin 7 /\u03b21 integrin/FAK/SRC pathway has been identified as a novel signaling pathway involved in the pathogenesis of ASD and ID.Furthermore, research has shown that tetraspanin 7 deficiency alters synaptic structure, impairs learning and weakens memory. 29Recent studies have shown that tetraspanin 7 affects dendritic spine formation, glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and neuronal plasticity.Therefore, this protein is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as HD, 25 fragile X syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy.Tetraspanin 7 plays a crucial role in the regulation of bone resorption by osteoclasts and cytoskeletal remodeling in vitro, as previously described by Kwon et al. 30 It is also involved in the formation of sealing zones and bone resorption activity of osteoclasts.In addition, Tetraspanin 6 and Tetraspanin 7 were shown to interact with glutamate receptors, highlighting the importance of individual tetraspanins in critical processes in the CNS.Tetraspanin 7 mutations are associated with ID, whereas tetraspanin 6 overexpression is linked to AD. 31 Tetraspanin 6 levels are elevated in the brains of patients suffering from AD, and its overexpression in cells affects amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism. 3 This tetraspanin assists T and B cells in epitope identification.It has been suggested that tetraspanin 7 may serve as an autoantigen in diabetes, making it useful for diabetes prediction and immunotherapy. 32Tetraspanin 7 is a surface marker of mature pancreatic endocrine cells 35\n[2] Exit by Exosome Two tetraspanins reduce \u03b2-catenin\u2013dependent signaling by promoting the extracellular release of this signaling protein in exosomes. Tetraspanins are transmembrane proteins that show decreased abundance in various tumors. In contrast, increased abundance of \u03b2-catenin is associated with colon cancer. Basal phosphorylation by glycogen synthase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) targets \u03b2-catenin for proteosomal degradation; signals that prevent GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation enable the nuclear translocation of stabilized \u03b2-catenin and initiation of gene transcription. Previous microarray analysis suggested that the tetraspanin CD9 may inhibit Wnt signaling, leading Chairoungdua et al. to investigate a possible link. In cells expressing \u03b2-catenin, cotransfection of the tetraspanins CD9 or CD82, but not CD63, decreased the cytoplasmic and nuclear abundance of \u03b2-catenin and the activity of a \u03b2-catenin transcriptional reporter. The decrease in \u03b2-catenin abundance did not occur through degradation by proteasomal or lysosomal pathways and did not require GSK-3\u03b2. Instead, the localization of \u03b2-catenin changed from nuclear (when a control plasmid or CD63 was cotransfected) to punctate and membrane-associated (when CD9 or CD82 was cotransfected). Electron microscopy revealed that \u03b2-catenin was released in exosomes. Besides coexpression of CD9 and CD82, exosomal release of \u03b2-catenin required E-cadherin, and CD82 coimmunoprecipitated with \u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin in transfected cells. Bone marrow\u2013derived dendritic cells from Cd9\u2013/\u2013 knockout mice released fewer exosomes than those from wild-type mice, suggesting a functional role for CD9 in exosome formation. Thus, CD9 and CD82 antagonize \u03b2-catenin\u2013dependent signaling by promoting the extracellular release of \u03b2-catenin in exosomes. A. Chairoungdua, D. L. Smith, P. Pochard, M. Hull, M. J. Caplan, Exosome release of \u03b2-catenin: A\n[3] LT-HSCs, resulting from increased stem cell activation and reduced quiescence signaling (Hur et al., 2016;Saito-Reis et al., 2018). In contrast, HSCs from CD81KO mice appear to proliferate similarly to control animals, but demonstrate a reduced ability to reenter quiescence after stimulation (Lin et al., 2011). Interestingly, the signaling molecules described to be involved in the regulation of quiescence include both Akt and TGF\u03b2 signaling (Lin et al., 2011;Hur et al., 2016). The modulation of Akt and TGF\u03b2 signaling by CD81 and CD82, respectively, likely involves the scaffolding property of these tetraspanins and their ability to cluster receptors and downstream signaling molecules into TEMs. Future experiments utilizing advanced imaging technologies will be required to confirm how tetraspanins and the dynamic assembly of TEMs influence these quiescence signaling pathways. TETRASPANINS: ASYMMETRIC DIVISION AND DIFFERENTIATION The balance between HSC self-renewal and differentiation is thought to be regulated by asymmetric cell division, where a cell Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology www.frontiersin.org produces a daughter cell that retains intrinsic stem cell properties plus one that initiates differentiation (Ho, 2005;Caocci et al., 2017). Previous work identified a series of molecules expressed on HSCs that undergo asymmetric division, including CD133, CD71, CD62L, CD34, and the tetraspanins, CD53 and CD63 Giebel and Beckmann, 2007). In fact, CD53, in combination with CD63 served as more stringent markers for asymmetric division than the previously described CD133 and CD34 expression profiles Giebel and Beckmann, 2007). In this study, both CD53 and CD63 were linked to the endosomal compartment, which plays a critical role in protein\n[4] Tetraspanins regulate cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 Background The presence of the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD82 at HIV-1 budding sites, at the virological synapse (VS), and their enrichment in HIV-1 virions has been well-documented, but it remained unclear if these proteins play a role in the late phase of the viral replication cycle. Here we used overexpression and knockdown approaches to address this question. Results Neither ablation of CD9, CD63 and/or CD81, nor overexpression of these tetraspanins was found to affect the efficiency of virus release. However, confirming recently reported data, tetraspanin overexpression in virus-producing cells resulted in the release of virions with substantially reduced infectivity. We also investigated the roles of these tetraspanins in cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1. Overexpression of CD9 and CD63 led to reduced cell-to-cell transmission of this virus. Interestingly, in knockdown experiments we found that ablation of CD63, CD9 and/or CD81 had no effect on cell-free infectivity. However, knockdown of CD81, but not CD9 and CD63, enhanced productive particle transmission to target cells, suggesting additional roles for tetraspanins in the transmission process. Finally, tetraspanins were found to be downregulated in HIV-1-infected T lymphocytes, suggesting that HIV-1 modulates the levels of these proteins in order to maximize the efficiency of its transmission within the host. Conclusion Altogether, these results establish an active role of tetraspanins in HIV-1 producer cells. Background Persistence of HIV-1 in infected individuals is a major public health problem. Despite great advances in anti-retroviral therapies, the virus cannot be completely eliminated once infection is established. One (of the many)\n[5] B-cell surface; and Tspan12 deficiency leads to familial exudative vitreoretinopathy characterised by impaired vasculature development in the retina,35. A total of 33 tetraspanins are found in humans and each cell type is estimated to express as many as 20 different tetraspanins. Tetraspanins form dynamic nanoclusters that are distinct from lipid rafts,29, and recent evidence using super-resolution microscopy suggests that tetraspanin nanodomains are clusters of \u223c10 tetraspanins of just a single type. This is consistent with the specific phenotypes that have been observed in many tetraspanin knockout studies, although tetraspanin knockouts are typically well tolerated and there is evidence for functional compensation by related tetraspanins,29. An exciting breakthrough in tetraspanin research is the recent report of the first crystal structure of a fulllength tetraspanin. The Blacklow group showed that tetraspanin CD81 has a cone-like structure in which The variable region of the major extracellular region is indicated in blue. Tetraspanins have between 0 and 3 N-linked glycosylation sites and several cysteine residues which can be palmitoylated (indicated in blue). This model is based on the crystal structure of tetraspanin CD81; additional structures are required to determine whether this is a common structure for all tetraspanins. transmembranes 1 and 2 are separated at the top of the plasma membrane from transmembranes 3 and 4 ( Figure 2A). This forms a cavity in which a cholesterol molecule can bind, with its hydroxyl group co-ordinated by conserved polar amino acids within transmembranes 1 and 4. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that removal of the\n[6] function. A similar pattern of tetraspanin-8 expression was also observed in mice. Thus, distal and collecting tubules express tetraspanin-8 in normal kidney. In kidney with severe podocyte injury, the staining was remarkably expanded and enhanced. The conserved expression pattern across species suggests that tetraspanin has an important role in kidney diseases. This induced expression in tubules was not observed for other tetraspanins, CD151 and CD9, suggesting that tetraspanin-8 has a unique role in kidney diseases. The function of tetraspanin-8 in kidney has not been previously reported. In the field of cancer research, colorectal, hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinomas with higher tetraspanin-8 expression were shown to exhibit a higher frequency of invasion and metastasis than those with low expression, indicating that tetraspanin-8 regulates adhesion and motility via integrin and laminin-14, 16, 20 . In addition, Penas et al. showed that tetraspanin modulates wound healing via adhesion and motility of keratinocytes. Our in vitro study showed that tetraspanin-8 facilitates migration and invasion of renal tubule cells. Therefore, it is speculated that tetraspanin-8 is involved in the process of repair of renal tubules, in which tubular cells acquire the capacity to move along the basement membrane to re-epithelialize wounded nephrons . In our study, tetraspanin-8 staining did not always spatially coincide with tubular injury. This lack of local correlation indicates that tetraspanin-8 expression is not activated by a local mechanism, such as autocrine or paracrine secretion of TGF-\u03b2 . Instead, it indicates that systemic factors that are evoked by, or closely correlated with, the decline of\n[7] membranes and in model liposomes. Collectively, these results suggest that the proline at position 296 is necessary for optimal function.

The deficiency of Tspan3 has been associated with increased \u03b2-catenin signaling, leading to the promotion of cancer cell proliferation and survival [2].\n\nIn addition, Tspan3 has been shown to regulate the formation of lipid rafts and the organization of the plasma membrane, which is essential for cell-to-cell transmission and immune responses [4]. The deficiency of Tspan3 has been associated with impaired cell-to-cell transmission and immune responses, making it more susceptible to viral infections [4].\n\nIn conclusion, the deficiency of Tetraspanin-3 is associated with impaired stem cell-renewal and disease propagation due to its critical role in regulating HSC self-renewal, cell-to-cell transmission, and immune responses. Further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between Tspan3 deficiency and disease propagation.", "total_cost": 0, "elapsed": 15.837153434753418}]}
